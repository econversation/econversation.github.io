<p><strong>Work &amp; Education</strong></p>
<!-- I currently hold a permanent position as a Research Fellow in Economics within the [Faculty of Built Environment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/)  at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). Before that I was a lecturer at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk)  from 2007 to 2017. At Cambridge, I was a Fellow at [Murray Edwards College](https://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk)  and Senior Member at [Newnham College](https://newn.cam.ac.uk)  and Director of Studies in Economics for both Colleges. From 2007 to 2012, I was also a visiting lecturer at [LSE Summer School](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/summer-schools/Summer-School). -->
<p>I am an Economist by training. I joined the Bartlett at UCL as a

<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<!-- My research is primarily focussed on microeconomic and macroeconomic theory, with a smattering of empirical work thrown in for good measure. If there is one paper you would like to read, it should be the paper on automation and how it is likely to impact our social and economic system in the long-run. Or the one on why there are still so many poor countries trapped in the poverty trap. -->
<p>What fundamentally motivates my research is a <strong>curiosity to
understand the causes of poverty</strong>. Understanding poverty
requires unravelling the mechanisms that trap households and countries
in poverty. This, in turn, requires understanding the conceptual idea of
the <span class="fb">poverty traps</span>, i.e., a set of <span
class="fi">feedback loops</span> that make it <span class="hl">difficult
for households and countries to escape from its clutches</span>. It is
an issue that plagues both developing and developed societies alike and
affects a <span class="fi">broad range of policy issues</span>.
Understanding poverty traps requires distinguishing between the
mechanisms and feedback loops at play at the household level and country
level.</p>
<p><em>Individual-level poverty traps:</em> My research papers in
microfinance uses <span class="hl">contract theory and information
economics</span> to examine how microfinance institutions can be
designed to help give <span class="hl">households the wherewithal to
escape the poverty trap</span>. These are papers that focus on improving
the design of microfinance institutions to alleviate poverty.</p>
<p><em>Country-level poverty traps:</em> While we constantly use terms
like infrastructure and public capital in policy-making, their role in
modern economic growth theory is still not well understood. My research
examines the <span class="hl">role the role public capital formation
process plays in slowing down productivity and trapping countries in a
low per-capita income trap</span>.</p>
<p>My research also tries to understand the conceptual definition of
<strong>infrastructure</strong> and the role of <strong>social
spaces</strong> plays in either allowing markets to function efficiently
or in preventing them from doing so.</p>
<p><em>Infrastructure:</em> While infrastructure is often seen as the
solution to all problems, the <span class="hl">definition of
infrastructure varies from discipline to discipline</span>. The
surprising fact is that there is no universal definition of
infrastructure in either academia or the policy-making world. In my
ongoing work on infrastructure, I am trying to find a cogent definition
of infrastructure from the first principles and aim to develop a
functional taxonomy for infrastructure.</p>
<p><em>Markets:</em> Like infrastructure, while the term market is often
used across disciplines, its meaning varies across disciplines and
contexts. What is striking is that the the relationship between markets
and social space, as conceptualised by the philosopher Henri Lefebvre,
is still not well-understood. <span class="hl">My on-going research
examines the relationship between markets and social space</span>.</p>
<p>My research draws from both Economics and Philosophy and explores the
complicated relationship between social spaces and markets. It is also a
strand of research that explores the surprising commonality that exists
between <em>Friedrich Hayek’s</em> and <em>Henri Lefebvre’s</em> notion
of the market. This is particularly surprising because Hayek and
Lefebvre are philosophers that have inspired work on the opposite ends
of the political spectrum.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching</strong></p>
<!-- I am passionate about teaching economics and have taught a wide range of courses in my career hitherto. These include courses on microeconomics, macroeconomics, economic development, economic growth and Microfinance. I am currently teaching a basic economics course based on the new Core-Econ text, which transcends the sub-discipline boundaries within economics. The teaching material I have created over the years can be found on my website. -->
<p>I have spent the <span class="hl">last two decades teaching and
specialising in the pedagogy of Economics.</span> I have <span
class="hl">taught Economics at LSE, Edinburgh, Cambridge</span>
previously before joining UCL in 2017. I got interested in the pedagogy
of Economics as a PhD student at LSE when I found myself teaching
Macroeconomics for a course run by future Nobel laureates Sir <a
href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/faculty/christopher-pissarides"
class="lk">Christopher Pissarides</a> and Prof <a
href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/faculty/charles-bean">Charles
Bean</a>. Both of them were excellent teachers and mentors who instilled
the love of pedagogy in me.</p>
<p>From 2007 to 2017, I was a Director of Studies of Economics at
various colleges in Cambridge. Cambridge gave me the opportunity and
latitude to develop a unique pedagogy of Economics. I was able to
<em>borrow from my training in street theatre</em>. In this approach,
the educator draws from the life experiences of the students to create a
curiosity about the topic, which then becomes the basis of the learning
trajectory. It ensures that the learning process continues once the
student leaves the classroom.</p>
<p>The list of the courses I have created thus far along with the course
material are given below.</p>

<p><strong>Life</strong></p>
<p>I am enthusiastic about coding, design and Argentinian tango. Which
just means that I try hard and fail often. The occasional success keeps
me going. And everything I have learnt about the art of living, I learnt
from watching <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier">Frasier</a>. The key is
know when to be like Frasier and when not be like Fraiser.<span
