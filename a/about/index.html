<p><strong>About me</strong></p>
<p>Economist. Teacher. Social Scientist.</p>

<p><strong>Work</strong></p>
<p>I am currently a Research Fellow in Economics in the Faculty of Built
Environment at UCL. Before that I was a lecturer at the University of
Cambridge from 2007 to 2017. At Cambridge, I was a Fellow at Murray
Edwards College and Senior Member at Newnham College and Director of
Studies in Economics for both Colleges. From 2007 to 2012, I was also a
visiting lecturer at LSE Summer School.</p>

<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>I obtained my PhD at LSE under the supervision of Prof. Maitreesh
Ghatak and Prof. Oriana Bandiera. I got my Bachelors at Hindu College
and Masters at Delhi School of Economics at Delhi University. Both in
Economics. I also have a MA (Cantab) from Cambridge.</p>

<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>My research is primarily focussed on microeconomic and macroeconomic
theory, with a smattering of empirical work thrown in for good measure.
My research papers can be found here and here. If there is one paper you
would like to read, it should be the paper on automation and how it is
likely to impact our social and economic system in the long-run. Or the
one on why there are still so many poor countries trapped in the poverty
trap.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching</strong></p>
<p>I am passionate about teaching economics and have taught a wide range
of courses in my career hitherto. These include courses on
microeconomics, macroeconomics, economic development, economic growth
and Microfinance. I am currently teaching a basic economics course based
on the new Core-Econ text, which transcends the sub-discipline
boundaries within economics. The teaching material I have created over
the years can be found here. There are also some short teaching notes on
a range of topics that can be found here.</p>

<p><strong>Life</strong></p>
<p>I am enthusiastic about coding, design and Argentinian tango. Which
just means that I try hard and often fail. The occasional success keeps
me going. And everything I have learnt about the art of living, I learnt
from Frasier.</p>
