<p>Hi Selcuk,</p>
<p>I have had to deal with a bit of crisis this morning in 0058. Someone in the administration seems to have taken a decision to effectively merge the Study Skills courses with 0058. A separate Moodle page was never created for the Study Skills course and now it seems to now be running out of a 0058 page.</p>
<p>No submission box has been created for the Study Skills course. Yet, the students have been set a really short four-day deadline for an assignment in the first week that was abruptly changed to a three-day deadline on Monday (today) morning. I have 10 emails from students complaining about Study Skills assignment. A three-day deadline may be fine for a writing course, but it is too short a deadline for an Economics assignment. The students are concerned and confused because the assignment is posted on 0058 page they think it is an Economics assignment.</p>
<p>I have spoken to Andy Bone at least 4 times in the last two weeks to coordinate and we get along really well. Given our interest in pedagogy, we understand each other perfectly well. We have both worked hard to coordinate the two courses and the academic side of things have been meticulously worked out between us. It seems CLIE was just following the lead that they had been given from within CPM administration. So, my concern is not with the academic side of the Study Skills course. My concern is with the administration of the Study Skills course within CPM.</p>
<p>The key issue is that the learning objectives for the 0058 Economics course and Study Skills course are very different. While students will benefit from coordination between the two courses, giving them a separate identity is extremely important.</p>
<p>I know that this is a busy time for you, so I paused for a bit before writing to you. I am only writing to you because I can see that this is going to be a problem and it is best to nip it in the bud.</p>
<p>Happy to chat anytime and hear your thoughts on it.</p>
<p>With best wishes,
Aniket</p>

<p>Hello Aniket,</p>
<p>Thank you for the heads up.</p>
<p>I am having a meeting tomorrow with Andy Wilkinson, and this is at the top of my agenda.</p>
<p>I have been observing the correspondence on this and today I checked the Moodle year page for Year 1. I saw that there is a dedicated section there. And as you rightly say, this has been the intention since the very beginning. Having said this, there is an unfortunate wording that might cause confusion on the dedicated space. The diagnosis task is expressed as ‘economics’ task, which is not how we want this to be advertised. I will now send an email to Andy Bones and Andy Wilkinson to pay maximum attention to this. Our meeting with Andy Wilkinson is between 12:30-13:30 tomorrow (Tuesday). Please do join if you are unavailable anytime during the meeting and we can have a chat. Let me know if you can join and I will send you the link.</p>
<p>I will be in touch again to see how things are moving forward even if you cannot join the meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and help.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

To: &quot;Begum, Ruhana&quot; &lt;ruhana.begum@ucl.ac.uk&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Dear Ruhana,</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this email is to avert an impending crisis in BCPM 0058. The secondary purpose is to set out in detail the series of crises I have had to cope with due to Andy Wilkinson’s negligent attitude towards the administration of the course. After each crisis, I have had to work hard to reassure the students and regain their trust, only for Andy Wilkinson to create a new crisis.</p>
<p>The submission deadline for Term paper for BCPM 0058 is on 1st April. The submission box is not yet up. If past pattern is anything to go by, Andy Wilkinson is unlikely to put up the submission box until the last day. I hope you would appreciate how important it is to create a reliable and reassuring environment for students. It is very important to create a submission box at least a couple of weeks in advance so that early submitters can alert us to any problem that may occur. I can’t imagine any downside to put up the submission box early.</p>
<p>The reason I am extremely concerned is because Andy Wilkinson constantly forgets to put up the submission box. The submission deadline for the last term paper was on 7th December. I got a series of panicked emails from students on the 4th December saying that they could not find the submission box. When I contacted Andy, all I got was a nonchalant response saying he had forgotten to put up the box.</p>
<p>It is difficult to over-estimate the sense of crisis it creates for the students. The students obviously blame the Module leader for problems like this. Unfortunately, this was not the first time Andy had forgotten.</p>
<p>Andy had created an even bigger crisis on the first week of the course. Selcuk had insisted that the Study Skills course (run by Andy Bone) should be run in coordination with BCPM0058. While I had meticulously coordinated the academic content with Andy Bone, the administrative side was Andy Wilkinson’s responsibility.</p>
<p>Andy Wilkinson took it upon himself to set a 3-day deadline for the first Study Skills assignment without consulting me or any other academic. Andy made no effort to assess the student’s workload. Further, Andy Wilkinson forgot to set up the submission box. I got around 15 emails in the first couple days of the course complaining that the deadline was unfair and they could not find the submission box. They obviously blamed me for the deadline because no one had bothered to explain to the students that Study Skills was distinct from BCPM0058.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to convey the sense of panic this created for the students on the first day of an academic year, a year which all the students were at the edge to start with. The student took to blaming me and I had to work really hard to rebuild the trust. It is a miracle that the student evaluation for BCPM 0058 were so good in spite of crises.</p>
<p>Please find attached the email I wrote to Selcuk on the evening of the 5th October, the first day of the teaching term. I am not sure what transpired between Selcuk and Andy Wilkinson. Selcuk wrote an extremely strong email to Andy Bone’s manager blaming him for the crisis. As far as I am concerned, this was an absolutely travesty. Andy Bone had gone over and above his call of duty to set up an extremely good Study Skills course and it was not his responsibility to administer the course. As a result of Selcuk’s email, Andy Bone and CLIE stopped cooperating with me on the BCPM 0058. The Study Skills never worked as it had intended and the students lost out.</p>
<p>There have been further small problems through the year like constant flow of emails asking me to make announcement for the course or asking me to change the submission deadline at the last minute. There are numerous other infractions. I don’t think detailing all of Andy Wilkinson’s rudeness and other infractions would serve any purpose.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that it has taken a herculean effort on my part to get the course back on track despite the chaos Andy has created. I would be very grateful if we could ensure that the submission box for the term paper goes up at the earliest and Andy Wilkinson can be encouraged to make at least some effort to provide administrative support for the course.</p>
<p>The way Andy has behaved over the course of year has not just let me down, he has also let down the hardworking students of BCPM0058 and other members of the Teaching and Learning Team who do such a fantastic job.</p>
<p>With best wishes,
Aniket</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Thank you for getting the forms. Unfortunately, I am in middle of something really hectic. I am serving on a public panel that ends on Monday evening. The panel is very time consuming and I am in meetings all day tomorrow and likely to work most of the weekend on for the Monday meetings. So, it is possible that I may not be able to get to these forms back to you before Tuesday. Having said that, I will try my best to find some time over the weekend and do the forms and get it back to you.</p>
<p>Regarding the forms, I can only identify the cases through Paper Id on Moodle. The forms you have sent me have students names and student ids. So, I don’t know how to link the papers I have on Moodle with the forms. Could you please send me the information that links Paper ids to the student details on the form.</p>
<p>Thanks a ton! :-)</p>
<p>With best wishes,

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Great! Thanks for that.</p>
<p>Re: release of the marks, the marks can only be released once the second marking is done. Due to all the changes in 0058, marking is proving to be an extremely cumbersome process and everyone is under pressure. So, it is important to get it right and tomorrow doesn’t look likely at this stage.</p>

<p>Good morning Aniket,</p>
<p>Due to the cases being suspected of contract cheating, I was required to forward your application to both the Chair of the UG Exam Board and the Faculty Tutor (in this circumstance, Peter McLennan) for consideration. I have received the following response about the claims.</p>
<p>Considering the attached individual claims and evidence provided, a case for academic misconduct cannot be taken forward at this time.</p>
<p>If you did want to proceed with it, a more clear analysis of the issue would be required with annotated or highlighted parts of the student’s individual assessment.</p>
<p>It maybe useful to refer to the Academic Manual that outlines the basic requirements for evidencing a misconduct case. See: <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure" class="uri">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure</a></p>
<p>The text under section 9.4.2.8 of Chapter 6 reads:</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In referring a case onto the Departmental Tutor, Departmental Panel, or Academic Misconduct Panel for consideration, the Module Convenor must send the following:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>An Academic Misconduct Report Form, with Parts 1 and 2 completed (see annex 6.1);</p></li>
<li><p>A copy of the affected assessment, where applicable annotated or highlighted to identify the extent of the Academic Misconduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Any other evidence relevant to the case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Due to Judy being involved in the marking process, the role of the Departmental Tutor stated in the regulations is passed to the Chair of the Examination Board.</p>
<p>If you do not want to proceed, please complete the marking and feedback for the three students on Moodle.</p>
<p>If you could let me know either way of your intention, I would be grateful.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<p>Dear Andy,</p>
<p>As Aniket spotted there is clearly something not quite right about the scripts. How else can we address these with the students without triggering the formal process that you were saying we don’t meet?</p>

<p>Hi Aniket and Judy,</p>
<p>When it comes to plagiarism or contract cheating, we do need to follow the formal Student Academic Misconduct process.</p>
<p>I would suggest providing more details/evidence on the form so that Selcuk and Peter are able to get a better understanding of the alleged plagiarism/contract cheating; this will allow them to question/investigate the situation during the panel.</p>
<p>In addition, please do mark the paper and provide the relevant feedback because if the panel does go ahead and decides there is no case of plagiarism/contract cheating then we will need to reinstate the student with feedback/mark immediately.</p>

<p>Dear Ruhana,</p>
<p>The case I had made was cause for further investigation based on the the principle of “academic judgement”. As you may appreciate, in case of contract cheating, there are only two ways to collected evidence.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A viva voce where there is attempt to ascertain whether the student displays any reasonable degree of knowledge that she or he would have acquired while writing the essay. In this case, the benefit of doubt should always favour the student.</li>
<li>We employ the services of MI5 or a capable detective agency that can give us direct evidence of contract cheating.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you may appreciate, 2) is impractical at the moment. Hence, I had made the case for further investigation based on my “academic judgement”.</p>
<p>If Peter McLennan and Selcuk Cidik are satisfied that all further investigations have been conducted and on balance of probabilities, they have made all effort to ensure that no contract cheating took place then I am happy to mark the exam.</p>
<p>However, Peter McLennan and Selcuk Cidik must not use “discretionary principle” to shut down the investigation. They need to exercise “academic judgement” to investigate or find someone who is ready to exercise “academic judgement”. This would require them going through the course material and then reading the essay. Once they have done that and put in writing that they see no cause to investigate further, I am happy to mark.</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br />

<p>Dear Ruhana,</p>
<p>I must add that after I had identified cause for concern in three BCPM0058 term paper submissions, Andy (I presume in consultation with Selcuk) had suggested the misconduct route. Hence, the misconduct route was not chosen by me and I am not wedded to the misconduct route.</p>
<p>I just want further investigations to be carried out to rule out contract cheating in line with the UCL academic policy.</p>

<p>Dear Kumar,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Andy was correct to signpost you to the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure, with any suspicion of contract cheating/Plagiarism this is the route that UCL advises. Please see the email below from Peter McLennan.</p>
<p>Please can you inform Andy and myself how you would all like to proceed.</p>
<p>Dear Selcuk</p>
<p>Not sure I understand what the issue is given these papers.</p>
<p>Unless the module leader can more clearly articulate the issues, I cannot see that there is a case for academic misconduct. The lack of clear analysis of the module leaders points with reference to the coursework does not indicate the need for a viva voce at this time.</p>
<p>It would be useful to point the module leader to the Academic Manual that outlines the basic requirements for evidencing a misconduct case. See: <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure" class="uri">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure</a></p>
<p>The text under section 9.4.2.8 of Chapter 6 reads:</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In referring a case onto the Departmental Tutor, Departmental Panel, or Academic Misconduct Panel for consideration, the Module Convenor must send the following:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>An Academic Misconduct Report Form, with Parts 1 and 2 completed (see annex 6.1);</p></li>
<li><p>A copy of the affected assessment, where applicable annotated or highlighted to identify the extent of the Academic Misconduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Any other evidence relevant to the case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Module Convenor has not followed this process, so in this instance so we cannot move these cases forward at this time.</p>

<p>Hello Aniket,</p>
<p>As Judy stated in her email, it would be very helpful for everyone on the panel, as well as the student, if there is some explanation of where your suspicion is stemming from.</p>
<p>So, you could highlight a sentence or a paragraph and add a comment saying, for example, ‘we did not look at this topic in the course, so it is suspicious that the student spent 1/5 of the word count discussing this’. Or something like, ‘we looked at this topic with an emphasis on xxx and yy – however what student is talking about is advanced argument that is not covered in the module or in the reading list’.</p>
<p>I hope that this helps clarifying in terms of what is the explanation/evidence that the panel would need to run an effective and fair viva voce.</p>
<p>Once you are done with preparing the case, please contact me. I am happy to have a look at them and discuss my opinion with you before we again formally put them in the process and seek for Faculty Tutor’s approval.</p>

<p>Dear Selcuk and Judy,</p>
<p>Following on from the conversation with Judy this evening, I have highlighted the text in the term papers that raise the suspicion. I have also partially changed the text in the misconduct form and attached them to the email as a zipped folder. The folders are organised case wise.</p>
<p>My text in the misconduct form is very deliberate and I would not like to change it significantly at this stage. The set of reasoning is slightly long and complicated and related to what I see as the ambiguities and shortcomings in the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure and stark punishment for contract cheating. If I had to summarise my argument very briefly, the evidence for customised contract cheating by definition is subjective subject to expertise and I don’t want to try to fit it into an objective evidentiary framework.</p>
<p>My understanding from my conversations with Judy was that we will get to the bottom of this within CPM through a framework she had set up last summer. I think what I have written should hopefully be enough for that.</p>
<p>I am attaching files for two cases to the email. The files for the third case is too large to send through email. I will send it through the UCL Drop box. Please do let me know if there is any trouble opening the zipped file. If there is trouble opening the files, I can send the file individually.</p>
<p>With best wishes,
Aniket</p>
<p>PS: Ruhana was asking for reference earlier today on contract cheating. Eaton et al (2018) is a very comprehensive article to read on how Universities are dealing (or not dealing in most cases) with contract cheating across the world.</p>

<p>Dear Aniket,</p>
<p>First of all. It is my and Ruhana’s understanding of UCL Academic manual that we can’t have an investigation through the framework Judy set up within CPM. I also discussed with Judy yesterday and she was going to talk to Aeli about ways to handling this in CPM moving forward. However, I believe we have all come to an understanding that at the moment that is not an option.</p>
<p>Secondly, thank you for the highlighted submissions - I looked at them.</p>
<p>My initial observations are as below, but I would like to have a chat with you in order to decide together which cases to uphold and forward to the faculty tutor for approval of a viva voce.</p>
<p>Rana Hijazi:</p>
<ul>
<li>This has the highest amount of highlighted text. And the text highlighted seems to be discussing topics of the module in a different way than instructed in the module (right?). So, although I would still like to have a chat with you about this, my view is that there may be enough evidence to create suspicion and conduct an investigatory viva.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yichen Lin:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is highlighted is mainly the paraphrased parts that are referenced. There is 1 sentence that is highlighted and not referenced. So, I understand that your issue is with the references. However, in the coursework brief, you suggest the following:
<ul>
<li>References are only required when quoting material beyond the course material.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Looking at the statement above from the coursework brief, my view is that there is not enough evidence to create suspicion and conduct an investigatory viva. But again, I am happy to discuss through it to better understand if there is anything that I am missing here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jiaqian Huang:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are highlights on paraphrased and other text. The references seem to be coming from a wide range which creates some suspicion. Looking at the poor language, I believe this is student’s own work but my view is that there may be enough evidence to create suspicion and conduct an investigatory viva.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have already sent you an MS Teams message to arrange a time for a chat. Please let me know of your availability as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Judy, please do attend our conversation if you would like. Please let us know if you want to join and we will find a time that works for all three of us.</p>

The advice was on process NOT on this case so no conflict of interest has arisen</p>
<p>This should be considered under Flexibility in the first section</p>
<p>Aniket please grade the 3 works and include the feedback on misconduct on the feedback
Students will then have opportunity to refute and a chat with me ( and Selcuk if he wants)</p>
<p>Please follow expedited process from there.
The ambivalence that is created by 100% summative assessment and the current framework will be addressed by dept guidance on the latter tao avoid time wasting. I will be asking staff to develop this asap.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I think what Ruhana is saying, if this is the process that will be followed, then the following should happen:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The feedback to the students about academic misconduct needs to mention whether the allegations are about collusion or plagiarism (the only two types of academic misconduct that can be adjudicated by the module convenor)</li>
<li>The penalty applied due to collusion/plagiarism must be in line with the procedure and clearly communicated to the student</li>
<li>The students must be sent an email about what happens next, and what they could do (i.e. Expedited Academic Misconduct Process should be explicitly communicated with the students)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if the allegation is ‘contract cheating’ (isn’t it the case?), as far as I understand, this is not an option. Because the ‘adjudicator’ set out for contract cheating is not the module convenor.</p>
<p>This is causing all of us to spend a big amount of time, and we still don’t seem to be in agreement.</p>
<p>Can we just not come together for 15 mins (Aniket, Judy, Ruhana, myself) and decide what to do and close this?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am reasonably available and happy to do it.</p>
<p>Please let me know.</p>

<p>Dear All,
FOR CLARITY ( and yes if you are hearing screaming you are not mistaken )</p>
<p>Contract cheating can only be referred up by the departmental panel. <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.4" class="uri">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.4</a>
9.4.5. The implication ( but not explicit statement unfortunately) of the academic manual is that contracts cheating is extremely unlikely to be found, proven and adjudicated immediately. It is more likely to be found to be the case after investigating some other kind of plagiarism. We will clarify this in a dept handbook that someone lucky is going to put together.</p>
<p>It should not have gone to Peter without consulting me as Dept tutor. Having Aeli involved or not has nothing to do with this - we skipped a step. That much is clear. And it is the reason why the process with Peter wasted so much time. We did not fully consider what the misconduct was In the department. Over use of words ’contract cheating” which I myself used. Mea a bit culpa. But My impression was we would convene a quick plagiarism panel as per processionals agreed last year.
<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.2" class="uri">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.2</a></p>
<p>In Aniket’s feedback there are sounds for a contract cheating thing - there are grounds for pretty much ALL misconducts. See section 9.2. 2 above.
I note that they are 1st years and therefore we have two options open to us given the level of evidence we have.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Expedited process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Penalty Table - Flexibility</p>
<p>Currently section 9.3 ‘Adjudication and Penalty Guidance’ offers a structured table of penalties to ensure a greater level of consistency across UCL. Feedback provided during 2019-20 highlighted that on some occasions the suggested penalty may be inappropriate. The following has been agreed for 2020-21:
In cases where it is felt that the penalty indicated in the guidance table is unsuitable in light of the particular circumstances of a case, an exceptional circumstances application can be made to the Faculty Tutor who, in consultation with the Chair of Academic Misconduct Panel where necessary, can offer approval to deviate from the guidance.
Such cases may include, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small amounts of Plagiarism on a highly weighted component, which may then result in a disproportionate penalty of 0%</li>
<li>Where the student has already failed the component or module, and an alternative penalty may be more appropriate</li>
<li>Cases where there may be an unintended effect on a student’s progression or award</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Poor academic practice</li>
</ol>
<p>9.4 Procedures</p>
<p>9.4.1 Module Convenor - Poor Academic Practice</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Where the Module Convenor is presented with evidence of the representation of work or ideas as the student’s own without appropriate referencing or acknowledgement, they must determine whether this amounts to Plagiarism or Poor Academic Practice with reference to 9.2.2 above.</li>
<li>Where the Module Convenor deems the evidence to amount to Poor Academic Practice, they must take the following action to address this:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Require the student to undertake UCL’s Introduction to Academic Integrity course; and</p></li>
<li><p>Require the student to meet with the Departmental Tutor, Departmental Graduate Tutor or Programme Leader to discuss the Poor Academic Practice and receive warning that any further instances of Poor Academic Practice would be deemed to amount to Academic Misconduct and penalised as outlined in 9.3; and</p></li>
<li><p>Require the student to present the work in question with corrections to address all of the Poor Academic Practice. If the student fails to present such work the matter will be dealt with as one of plagiarism. Presenting the corrected work will not count as another assessment ‘attempt’. The original mark awarded to the work prior to the corrections being made will stand but will only be entered formally on the record once the corrected version of the work has been presented.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the Poor Academic Practice is recorded on the module minutes in Portico.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s go for the second ?? IF ONLY BECAUSE ITS IN BLACK AND WHITE IN FRONT OF US FROM THE MANUAL ????</p>
<p>Please let me know you are all happy to proceed with poor academic practice - or expedited process if you object.</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>First of all, Judy, I understand that you are angry, but nobody is trying to be difficult here. I spent as much, perhaps more, time on this, and I am very busy too. What I am trying to do is to deal with this following the respective procedures. Since the very beginning I am saying one thing: let’s decide what the allegation is and follow the process.</p>
<p>Second, as long as the concern is ‘poor academic practice’, then I do not, and cannot, have any objection for Aniket to follow ‘Poor Academic Practice’ route that you quoted in your email below. It is in module convenor’s discretion to start and apply the process as instructed in the academic manual.</p>
<p>Having said that, I want to highlight the definition of ‘poor academic practice’ taken from UCL Academic Integrity website (<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/academic-integrity" class="uri">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/academic-integrity</a>):</p>
<p>Poor Academic Practice
Poor Academic Practice is the failure to follow the referencing and citation conventions for your discipline because you have not yet received guidance or training on how to do this. If this is the case, UCL may view any referencing and citation mistakes in your work more leniently and not as Academic Misconduct. You will be given the opportunity to meet your department to discuss your work, take UCL’s ‘Introduction to Academic Integrity’ course, and present the piece of work again with the relevant corrections to address the issues.</p>
<p>Aniket, if this is the process that you are following, can you please share the procedure with the students when you let them know about the allegation. Also, I would be happy to meet them and talk to them if you would like me to.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Dr. Mustafa Selçuk Çıdık</p>

<p>Not angry. The reference to screaming was the reference to frustration at how difficult it is to address clear definitions about process here. The type size is huge here and it wasn’t when I sent it - sorry if it upset. Due to copying from website I imagine. Please do not interpret that as anger, but there is a great deal of frustration.
We will make an appointment of someone to own the process more generally in the dept.</p>
<p>I have already provided the definitions ? And also the process. Therefore, it almost looked like you were making further modification to the process, but I am sure you are not.</p>
<p>If Aniket is ok with referring is as poor academic practice - he will as per previous email mark the scripts and they will be returned according to the process set out in 9.4.1 below.</p>
<p>Very happy for you to be at the meeting w the students too as part of this process. It’s to help them.</p>
<p>Aniket let me know if you are happy.</p>
<p>FT(AR) and PMcL are aware of process.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Best Dr Judy Z. Stephenson</p>

<p>You are right, I had absolutely no intention to modify the process.</p>
<p>I just did not quite get what the students will be asked to do as part of point ‘iii’. So, I looked for a more comprehensive definition of ‘poor academic practice’ to better understand what they will need to do when they revise their work under ‘iii’. Based on the definition that I found, and the statement under ‘iii’ (“the case will be treated as plagiarism in case student fails to revise”), my understanding is that the students should mainly be asked to properly reference/cite their work when they revise it.</p>
<p>So, I haven’t understood how this will help addressing Aniket’s concerns, which are not about referencing/citations. This is the only reason I shared that definition. I guess you have a different interpretation of the process.</p>
<p>And yes, I would be happy to be part of the meeting with the students, thanks!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>Dear Selcuk,</p>
<p>Summary: firstly, since the meeting ii) occurs before the students make the changes or correct work they will know what to do.</p>
<p>Secondly, as the definition you provide as well as the academic manual’s procedure makes clear the process implies that the student will be given direction on what to do.</p>
<p>In detail:
Again, I’m a little bit confused about what the confusion is - Is it because you are querying whether we are alleging contract cheating or other academic misconduct or poor academic practice? Is it because there is some other kind of confusion?</p>
<p>Here I clarify again. The essays that Aniket has pulled out have lots of indications of either somebody else having written them or plagiarism. Those indications are that they don’t reflect the course material and they use language and terminology that is found possibly from another source.</p>
<p>These indications could be used as suspicion of contract cheating. That was our suspicion. Like everybody has spotted here there is not enough evidence to support a claim of contract cheating at the moment- this happens a lot and it’s not surprising. Please note my clarification from the earlier email</p>
<p>“Contract cheating can only be referred up by the departmental panel. <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.4" class="uri">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.4</a> 9.4.5. The implication ( but not explicit statement unfortunately) of the academic manual is that contract cheating is extremely unlikely to be found, proven and adjudicated immediately. It is more likely to be found to be the case after investigating some other kind of plagiarism.”</p>
<p>(this interpretation has been discussed with higher powers by the way, therefore, it will be clarified in some kind of department guide as I also indicated earlier).</p>
<p>So, in answer to how will the students know what to do: in the meeting ii) We will be asking the students to to tell us about how they wrote the essay and why they used the terminology they did. We will highlight what we thought was poor and indicated bad practice, there will be an encouraging and supportive conversation that tells them how to change this , so iii) can happen and then write in their own words without paraphrasing any other source, an answer to the question that’s clearly engages with the course material rather than any other source.</p>
<p>Without knowing exactly what the indications of paraphrasing, use of terminology from other popular management sources, use of terminology similar to other submitted or familiar work are a result of we had two options – to proceed under the expedited process on submissions of plagiarism, or to proceed with poor academic practice because they were first years.</p>
<p>The goal of either a departmental panel informal Viva voce, which would be the result of the expedited process or the poor academic practice process is to find out from the students why they are producing work like this and help them to improve and write their own original work.</p>
<p>The poor academic practice process is laid out below clearly states what is to happen and what the steps are. I hope that this email has cleared up any confusion that might still the present?</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>Thank you for the clarification. Let’s proceed this way then.</p>
<p>Aniket, in the end, you will decide which cases to bring forward. However, having seen your highlighted student work and the assessment brief, my personal opinion is that Yichen Lin’s case may deserve a second look before putting the student through the process. I am copying my previous comments about this student below:</p>
<p>Yichen Lin:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is highlighted is mainly the paraphrased parts that are referenced. There is 1 sentence that is highlighted and not referenced. So, I understand that the issue is the references used in the submission. However, in the coursework brief, you suggest the following:
<ul>
<li>References are only required when quoting material beyond the course material.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Looking at the statement above from the coursework brief, my view is that there is not enough evidence to suggest any problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, as long as Ruhana is happy with this, Aniket can you please complete the marking as soon as possible, so that we can release the marks to all students.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Dr. Mustafa Selçuk Çıdık</p>

<p>Dear Selcuk,</p>
<p>You have misunderstood the evidence in Yichen Lin’s case. I want to restrain myself from writing anything at this stage because I don’t want to pre-judge.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why I have been cautioning against pre-judgement. The evidence is subject to expertise and it is easy to misread the evidence if read without the expertise. This is why, at this stage, it is subjective evidence and should not be read like objective evidence.</p>
<p>Every word I have written in mis-conduct form has meaning. Once this is over, I am happy to explain my reasoning in detail. When I do so, it would be clear why Yichen Lin case is so complicated.</p>
<p>With best wishes,
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Aniket &amp; Niko,</p>
<p>A Teams channel for BCPM0008 has been created, it includes the relevant markers for this module. On the Team’s channel you will see the uploaded assessment marksheet with Turnitin paper numbers. Please update the spreadsheet on Teams (rather than downloading a copy) so that all markers are working on the same version.</p>
<p>I have allocated the 1st and 2nd marking on the assessment marksheet on Teams as per the Module leader allocation doc here on BCPM0008 Assessment marksheet</p>
<p>Please note there is a change to the second marking process. We are no longer using the 2nd marking form. The 2nd marker provides feedback notes on the assessment marksheet and notifies the 1st marker once completed. Please see the process attached above.</p>
<p>The numbers that are in red on the spreadsheet are late submissions. Results are to be released to the students by 24th May 2021.</p>
<p>There are 4 students that have not submitted at present. Three of these student’s have a 1-week or 2-weekk EC. I will update the schedule of assessment marksheet as the remaining students submit. In addition, I will be sending an email through Moodle to the student that has not submitted to remind them to do so.</p>
<p>Please email me once the marking is finalised and agreed, could you ensure the assessment marksheet on the Teams channel is updated and accurate so that the Teaching and Learning team can do their checks, before results are released to the students.</p>
<p>If you think that a penalty needs to be applied to any of the assessments please discuss this first and/or add a note on the marksheet, this is to ensure that penalties are applied consistently across the module. Do not worry about applying any late submission penalties as I will do this before the marks are released.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the marking process please let us know.</p>

<p>Hi Niko &amp; James,</p>
<p>James - thanks a ton for setting it all up so efficiently. Really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Niko, I have put together everything you would need to mark the term paper in the attached pdf document. It contains a marking guide, links to all relevant 0008 course material and the assessment brief for the term paper and the marking criteria.</p>
<p>All the course material for 0008 is on Moodle. I also maintain a copy of the material on my personal website where everything is more easily accessible. <a href="http://www.aniket.co.uk/pages/condev.php" class="uri">http://www.aniket.co.uk/pages/condev.php</a></p>

<p>Just a couple of things. If you have any papers that you feel may require investigation for academic misconduct do please let me know and I can forward on the updated guidance for this.</p>
<p>Regarding wordcounts that exceed the limit. Do please add the offending figure for the relevant assessments - I can then add the appropriate penalty.</p>
<p>I’ll also add the penalties for the late submissions as I have access to all that information.</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>Thanks for this.</p>
<p>I did not see any submissions that would pass our usual academic misconduct test. A few borderline cases but I don’t think they are worth pursuing.</p>
<p>The same applies to word counts. The target was flexible enough that all submissions can interpret their word count in a way that avoids penalties, so I do not think we should issue any penalties.</p>
<p>I’m happy to discuss if <code>@Aniket</code>, Kumar disagrees.</p>
<p>best,
Niko</p>

<p>Hi Niko,</p>
<p>I absolutely agree regarding the work count.</p>
<p>Sorry for delay in second marking. I was finishing off the first marking for another course and just finished. I am going through 0008 today and you should be done by later today.</p>

<p>Good morning both,</p>
<p>Hope you had a good weekend.</p>
<p>Just to update you I received notification that one of the 0008 students was granted deferral to the Late Summer Assessment Period. This student’s paper had been first marked and is Turnitin ID 150486812. Notifying you both now that I’ll be removing this paper from Moodle and the BCPM0008 Mark sheet.</p>

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>I hope all is going well with the marking. Do please update me if there are any issues.</p>
<p>Surprisingly an assessment was submitted today, 3 weeks after deadline - 153467911 - 17/05/21, 02:16<br />
This student had not applied for an EC. Therefore, as the submission was more than 5 working days late they’ll be marked as 1.00% / Grade E.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Dear Judy, Niko and James,</p>
<p>The sampled second marking process revealed a large variation between Niko and my marks. I spent the last two days trying to find a way so that we can 1) award marks that are fair to the students and 2) without elongating the process further.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the fairest way would be for me to blind-second marks the whole set and provide a clear rationale for the marks I have awarded. (See below my simple marking framework.)</p>
<p>My marks and comments are attached in the file titled “Aniket’s_marks_comments.pdf”. Also attached is a figure titled “0008_marks_graph.pdf”. This contains a graphical representation of Niko and my marks (blind second marking). The blue points are the ones where the variation between Niko and my marks are large and require third marking by Judy. It is great that Judy has stepped in to adJudycate as the third marker (pun fully intended :-) ).</p>
<p>I have updated my marks on the excel file in Teams. (I have left out the comments for now, since my long comments mess up the layout.) I have also created a column that indicates whether the script requires the third marker in my opinion. Happy to add or take away scripts as needed from this list. For the rest, I presume we can just take the average.</p>
<p>Judy - all this requires is looking at my Niko’s feedback (Moodle) and my feedback (attached file) and determining the mark. I am very happy to go along with Judy’s decisions. So, it can be done straight on Teams excel sheet.</p>
<p>Once we are done with this, Niko may need to change this feedback. Some of his feedback is a variance with the term paper brief (available on 0008 Moodle page since March) or UCL marking policies. The ones I noticed are given below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Remove comments about students being penalised for citations. The term paper brief (available since March) clearly says citations are not required.</li>
<li>Feedback that suggests that students are being penalised because there is a suspicion of plagiarism. If there is a suspicion of plagiarism, it needs to be raised separately and the requisite process needs to be followed. Students cannot be penalised for suspicion of plagiarism through the normal process of marking.</li>
<li>Feedback that suggests that students are being penalised for focussing or giving examples from any particular country. There is nothing in the term paper brief that prevents students from using examples of a country.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will leave it to Niko’s discretion on what he wants to change.</p>
<p>I have a big deadline looming on 21st May. I have already spent an inordinate amount of time on this. I am hoping that we can proceed smoothly by doing our bits on the excel sheet. As I said, I am happy to go along with whatever Judy decides on the marks.</p>
<p>Apologies for this long 543 words email. Hope it is useful!</p>
<p>With best wishes,
Aniket</p>
<p><code>---</code></p>
<p>My framework for marking was as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Has the student explained how infrastructure can raise income per-capita in a country through various channels?</li>
<li>Explaining this fully requires familiarity with the role markets play in Solow Growth Model and misallocation hypothesis. Reward students if they explain this well.</li>
</ol>

<p>Dear everyone,</p>
<p>The UCL academic manual is pretty clear on the process here.</p>
<p>If the second marker doesn’t agree on any one mark then full second marking must be carried out. My understanding from your email is that this has happened. Great. </p>
<p>Next: First and second markers must reconcile.</p>
<p>Where are you are less than 10% apart you can split the difference- unless it goes across a grade boundary. </p>
<p>Other than that marks must be reconciled through discussion of the criteria. </p>
<p>When the third marker is called in – thats me and I do like the pun – the third marker’s “role is not to override the two previous markers but to contribute to resolving the discussion with reference to the marking criteria”. So unfortunately… This is not about me determining the mark. I agree this would be quicker.</p>
<p>James can you grant me access to the teams box for the spreadsheet so I can see the marks and where there is disagreement. </p>
<p>Before doing so, Niko can you confirm that any marking down for citations, plagiarism, or a reference to a particular country has been resolved in your marks, as these things do seem to have been given to the students as part of the brief. </p>
<p>We will need the broken down marks in each marking criteria category for both markers.</p>
<p>Whilst I review please continue to attempt to reconcile as, unfortunately in this case, that is the means by which the academic manual directs us to mark. </p>
<p>V best, </p>
<p>Judy </p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Judy, I’m happy to confirm that I haven’t marked anyone down for lack of references, plagiarism or using examples. I’ll have a look at my feedback to make sure that it’s not suggesting that and revise to avoid confusion. I’ll do it before punching out today.</p>
<p>Aniket, thanks for bringing the confusion in my feedback to my attention.
To be clear, I’ve not marked anybody down for the things you mentioned but:
1. When I mentioned references I mark them down for not knowing (or referring to) the literature or using evidence. I will revise my feedback to make it clearer.
2. In cases where large chunks of text have been copied and pasted from somebody else’s work, I often penalise the student for lack of originality and critical thinking. Again, I will make it clearer.
3. Using a specific example is fine as long as it is representative or discussed in context. If it is not, it’s a bad example. I’m not sure what the problem is but will have a look.</p>
<p>Best,<br />
Niko</p>

<p>Dear Niko,<br />
Thank you for these clarifications.</p>
<p>Regarding plagiarism - in “ cases where a large chunks of the text have been copied and pasted from somebody else’s work “ as you say - please identify the student in the paper with James who will help you fill out an academic misconduct form and they will be penalised in a separate process. You don’t have to take it into account in the mark - although we all find that sloppy work and plagiarism have a high correlation! </p>
<p>Best - Judy </p>

<p>Hi Judy,</p>
<p>Thanks, but I think we’re talking about two different issues here.
The issue we have is with a student who copied sentences and did not interpret but simply accepted them.
I don’t think this is a plagiarism issue as we are not asking for references, but I do think that it demonstrates little original and critical thinking as well as a low level of understanding of the material. </p>
<p>I’m going through my comments right now and will get back to you in 30min.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I had a look at my comments.
There were two instances where I noted that there were no references which was confusing. I’ve now clarified or re-phrased this. 
Thanks for bringing this to my attention Aniket!</p>
<p>I also rephrased the comment about copying and pasting large chunks of text from somebody else’s work without interpretation. I hope this helps but I will speak to James about the misconduct form. </p>
<p>Judy, I think it’s ready for you. Many thanks for your help!
I think the major difference between mine and Aniket’s comments is that he focuses mostly on knowledge and understanding while in my feedback this is only 50% of the mark. </p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Great exchanges this morning. Ted Hastings’ favourite line about diesel comes to mind. :-) (please ignore this if you are not a Line of Duty fan)</p>
<p>I have averaged Niko’s and my marks and then rounded them off on the Team excel spreadsheet. In most cases, the results seemed fair and reasonable to me. I have identified two cases where we should have Judy look at it (lines with gray background).</p>
<p>150518270: Niko 43, Aniket 80, Average: 61.5. Given the large difference, it would be prudent if Judy can have a look and see if we need to move in one direction or other.</p>
<p>150366752: Niko 63, Aniket 74, Average 68.5. It is close to the class boundary and an umpire call from Judy would be very useful.</p>
<p>Judy, please find attached my detailed comments and the breakdown of marks for these two cases in the attached pdf.</p>
<p>For the rest of cases, I am happy to go with the averages unless Niko wants to flag up any more cases. As I said, to me the averages look pretty reasonable in all cases but the two aforementioned cases.</p>
<p>Hope this is useful!</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br />
Aniket</p>

<p>Just had a look in the spreadsheet and it does look like we have substantial progress. </p>
<p>I am taking it that Aniket is proposing that the marks in the agreed mark column are the compromise or reconciliations. As some of the marks were more than 20 marks apart Niko could you also confirm that you have criteria reasons to be happy with the marks that are now in the spreadsheet as agreed or if you want to suggest another compromise do so. </p>
<p>I am going to look at the two that are highlighted as not agreed now and return with some comments.</p>

<p>Dear All, 
I have looked at the two scripts</p>
<p>150366752</p>
<ul>
<li>This is better than the 63 but not quite 74 - I’m happy w the proposed 70 </li>
</ul>
<p>150518270</p>
<ul>
<li>This one is deceptively simple and authoritiave  - but not quite 1st level - May I suggest that the it meets the criteria for a higher grade in knowledge and understanding than Niko originally gave it as spotted by Aniket. I would suggest a final score somewhere in the mid 60’s for it - say 66. </li>
</ul>

<p>Hi Judy and Niko,</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I would absolutely abide by Judy’s advice and not elongate this any further.</p>
<p>But, I have spent the last few hours feeling extremely guilty. It is about 150518270. I told all my students again and again to write sharp, crisp analytical term papers. 150518270 has written an essay that is very similar to the answer guide that I wrote. Every important point that I stress on in the answer guide is there in the term paper. I just feel really guilty that I gave them wrong advice about how to write a term paper.</p>
<p>Having said that, I would absolutely abide by Judy’s advice on both papers.</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br />
Aniket</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>As you must have seen from the emails, I am fine with the agreed marks.</p>
<p>Judy asked for some more information yesterday and has not yet filled out the third markers comment column for 150518270. So, I am not sure if we are at the end of the marking process or Judy still wants to add something. Given how busy Judy usually is, it could be she is just dealing with something else at the moment.</p>
<p>The marks and fine for me, but may be an idea to check with Judy.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
Aniket</p>

<p>Thanks Judy,</p>
<p>Following on from Judy’s email. In addition to 150518270 needing to be set to 68 on the Marksheet and Moodle.</p>
<p>There are a number of other discrepancies which require amendments on the marksheet and their corresponding Moodle mark.</p>
<p>Column K, the agreed mark before penalties applied’ column (highlighted on the marksheet), most of the marks do not tally with the relevant Moodle entries.</p>
<p>Without these issues being resolved I am unable to release the marks to students.</p>
<p>Do please ensure the appropriate marking criteria are amended to apply the agreed final marks</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>Thanks for following up on this. 
As far as I understand column K gives our final agreed marks. <code>@Stephenson</code>, Judy and <code>@Aniket</code>, Kumar could you confirm?
If that is the case, the ball is in my court and I need to revise my moodle feedback (and marks) to match the marks agreed by the three marks in column K.
Is that what we need to do?</p>

<p>Niko, if you do it on Friday evening, the students will get the marks on Tuesday the 1st June. I don’t think it is fair to make the students wait that long for the marks.</p>
<p>Thank you Niko for the incredible amount of hardwork you have put in as the first-marker for 0008.</p>
<p>James, I will get the marks and spread sheet right now. It should be done in 10 minutes. Message me directly if any ends need to be tied up.</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>I can update the marks, but I can’t amend the first-marker’s comments. The comments belong to Niko and it up to him how he wants to amend it.</p>
<p>Even though it is not my role to update the marks, I volunteered to do the marks in order to expedite the process. Given how complicated the marking process has been and how much disagreement there has been about the marks, I would like to steer clear of anything controversial like amending the first-marker’s comments.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>I expect that we are going to have a spate of student complaints about the feedback when the marks are released. Unfortunately, there is little I can do. I had flagged up all the problems to Judy in a separate very long email last week and left it up to her how she wants to drive the process.</p>
<p>It is up to you, but you may consider getting Ruhana in the loop in case there are spate of student complaints. I would leave it up to you whether you would like to do that.</p>
<p>I will let you get some rest. Please do let me know in the morning if the marks are all in order. I am slightly dyslexic, so I am always reassured when someone double check the things I have done.</p>
<p>Goodnight!!!!</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>James was right to remind me that updating the marks is a complicated process. Updating the marks requires changing the breakdown and streamlining comments. When I had volunteered to update the marks, I had not realised that complications. Since the comments on the Moodle are first marker’s comments, it is not appropriate for me to mess with them. I left everything as it is.</p>
<p>Niko, it is best if I leave you do the marks and comments whenever you can.</p>

<p>Good afternoon all!</p>
<p>Thank you all for your hard work and efforts in completing the marking. After running a few checks I have just released the marks to the students and advised them to contact you if they have any questions regarding their feedback.
 
Please do not make any changes to the marking on Moodle from this point on. If you do need to change a mark due to an error please let me know beforehand so that we can complete the proper paperwork and ensure the correct marks are entered onto Portico.</p>

<p>Dear Aniket,</p>
<p>I hope you are well.<br />
It has been brought to my attention that two BCPM008 assignments submissions should be highlighted to you (as the module leader) as there could be cases of academic misconduct.</p>
<p>In my opinion two submissions show signs of poor academic practice (copying sentences from sources without appropriate citation). These are submissions: 150548023 and
150552599.</p>
<p>Please could you let me know what is your interpretation of this?</p>
<p>I attach a guidance document to make this easier for you. Judy is in CC as she suggested that I should flag these.</p>

<p>Hi Niko,</p>
<p>The key criteria for me when I was setting up the term paper question was in terms of how to make it plagiarism and contract-cheating proof. The question forces the student into original thinking and makes plagiarism difficult. Having said that, I have looked through all the scripts for plagiarism and contract cheating and at least I didn’t pick up any alarming signals.</p>
<p>Below are my initial thoughts on the two cases you have flagged up. Making a case requires forensic analysis of the term paper and establishing that plagiarism has compromised the originality of the term paper. I am absolutely happy to support you if you want to make a case for any of them.</p>
<p>Judy - you are an expert on this. Please do correct me if I have misunderstood what we need to do to make a plagiarism case.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful!</p>
<p>With best wishes,
Aniket</p>

<p>Hi Aniket,</p>
<p>Many thanks for a quick and considerate response.
I think that if we have a problem at all, we are looking at ‘poor conduct’ rather than plagiarism.
If you do not see any issues, I am more than happy to rely on your expertise in this matter and not purse this further.</p>
