<p>Market structure of an industry is the nature of the competition in
an industry or the market segment. It is essentially describes how many
firms operate within the industry and the way which which they
compete.</p>
This paper describes a simple framework that can be used to understand
how the market structure of an industry can be predicted based on three
parameters, i.e., sunk cost or fixed cost of developing a product, the
potential size of the market and the consumer’s preference for variety.

<!-- > **Market structure** of an industry is the nature of the competition in an industry or market segment. It is essentially describes how many firms operate within the industry and the way which which they compete. -->
<p> </p>
<p>Following <span class="citation"
data-cites="dixit1977monopolistic">@dixit1977monopolistic</span> and
<span class="citation"
data-cites="krugman1980scale">@krugman1980scale</span>, the market
structure is considered <em>endogenous</em>, i.e., the structure of
competition in the market is determined by some underlying fundamental
characteristics. <span class="citation"
data-cites="dixit1977monopolistic">@dixit1977monopolistic</span>’s
insight was to show that market competition will emerge from two key
factors.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Increasing returns to scale.</li>
<li>Consumer preference for variety.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is my parsimonious 3-parameter model that explains the key
insight of this generation of Dixit-Stiglitz-Krugman market structure
models that are currently being used across fields. The three parameters
are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> sunk cost or fixed cost
of developing a product.</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> potential size of the
market</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> consumer’s preference
for variety.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two parameters are related to the increasing returns to
scale. The third one is related to the consumer’s preference for
variety.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> on their own can explain the
supply side in all markets other than monopolistic competition. <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> is required to complete the model
on the demand side in monopolistic competition.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
<span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> was often assumed away in
the past when supply side economics was in its ascendancy. Yet, we find
that <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> is increasingly playing
a pivotal role in a large number of theoretical and empirical paper as
witnessed by the voluminous literature that has followed <span
class="citation" data-cites="melitz2003impact">@melitz2003impact</span>.
The important question for you is whether monopolistic competition
models are the relevant market structure model for climate change
geo-engineering approaches.</p>
<h1 id="supply-side">Supply side</h1>
<h2 id="increasing-returns-to-scale">Increasing returns to scale</h2>
<p>Take a very simple example of a production function with increasing
returns to scale, i.e., fixed cost of setting up a plant but zero
marginal cost of production.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Let’s say the fixed cost
of setting up production is <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>
and there is no variable cost. <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> includes all sunk cost, i.e.,
innovation, acquiring project specific human capital and cost of
establishing the brand.</p>
<p>Let’s say the market size is <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>. We will expand on <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> later in the section on consumer
preference. For now, let’s freeze the demand side and think of <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> as simply the pounds that can be
spent on buying goods in the market. It follows that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There would be <span class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}$</span> firms
in this market.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}$</span> is the key parameter
that determines the nature of competition in the market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an interesting paper, <span class="citation"
data-cites="krugman1987free">@krugman1987free</span> show that <span
class="math inline">$1&lt;\frac{M}{F}&lt;2$</span> in the jumbo jet
industry. The fixed cost <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> of
designing a jumbo jet is very high and the potential market size <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is comparatively low. Increasing
returns to scale restricts the number of firms in the market. Left to
its own devices, there would be only 1 jumbo jet manufacturer in the
market and other firms would have to exit. Yet, we have two, i.e.,
Boeing and Airbus.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="krugman1987free">@krugman1987free</span> shows that highly
scale oriented industries<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> have externalities through their
supply chain linkages. Each country thus has the incentive to capture
these externalities. Hence, the market competition in an industry like
the jumbo jet industry has become essentially a competition of strategic
trade policy between the US and EU.</p>
<p>Thus, it is no longer a strategic game between Boeing and airbus. It
becomes a strategic game between the US and Europe. Both US and Europe
are keen to subsidise their own jumbo jet firms for two reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These firms generate externalities that outweigh the subsidies
and be captured locally.</p></li>
<li><p>Each country hopes that one day their firms will take over the
market and if it does happen, then there are supernormal profits to be
earned. We can illustrate this with the following example. Let’s say
<span class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}=1.6$</span>. If someday Boeing
exits the market due to some unforeseen circumstances, then Airbus would
start earning 60% supernormal profit after its recovered <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="varying-m-and-f">Varying <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span></h3>
<p>There would be a large number of firms in the market segment if <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is high and <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is low. There would be a low
number of firms in the market segment if <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is low and <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is relatively high. Let’s discuss
the market structure for each range of <span
class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}$</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Case I:</strong> <span
class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}&lt;1$</span>: <strong>The market
doesn’t exist</strong>. There are a lot of markets that don’t exist
because the potential market size is smaller than the fixed cost of
starting production. E.g., drugs that can be invented for niche
diseases, but are not invented because the potential size of the market
doesn’t cover fixed costs.</p>
<p><strong>Case II:</strong> <span
class="math inline">$1&lt;\frac{M}{F}&lt;2$</span>: This is case of
<strong>monopoly</strong>, but as you can see below, monopolies are not
as simple as people presume they are. For <span
class="math inline">$1&lt;\frac{M}{F}&lt;2$</span> there should be only
one incumbent firm. The incumbent firm would earn supernormal rents
<span class="math inline">$(\frac{M}{F}-1)$</span> due to the fact that
there is only one firm in the market segment. It gives another
challenger firm with deep-pockets incentive to enter the market segment
and displace the incumbent. If the challenger enters, then it becomes a
game of wits and deep-pockets between the challenger and the incumbent.
<span class="citation"
data-cites="selten1978chain">@selten1978chain</span> shows that this
game becomes a game of credible threats of retaliation, i.e., reputation
to follow through on threats.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is very high, then it
is likely that there are a lot of supply chains and that implies that it
becomes a game of strategic exports between national governments (<span
class="citation"
data-cites="krugman1980scale">@krugman1980scale</span>).</li>
</ul>
<!-- ^[Even through the analysis in @schelling1980strategy and @schelling2014arms are about the nuclear arms race, there are parallels with climate change. It is all about the industrial race between the incumbent and the challengers to prevent a catastrophe.] -->
<p><strong>Case III:</strong> <span
class="math inline">$1&lt;\frac{M}{F}&lt;\underline{n}$</span>, where
<span class="math inline">$\underline{n}$</span> is small number greater
than 1, say 5. This is the case of <strong>oligopoly</strong>. If there
are a small number of firms in the market segment, the strategic game is
likely to ensure with potential for collusion.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the firms play Cournot, i.e., compete with each other in
quantities, there is always an implicit collusion equilibrium where the
firms make super-normal profits.</p></li>
<li><p>If the firms play Bertrand, i.e., compete in prices, then firms
make no profit over and above their costs.</p>
<p>Cournot competition takes firms in the direction of monopoly.
Bertrand competition takes the firms towards perfect competition. This
is why a good competition policy always tries to ensure that firms
compete in prices.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Further, a good competition policy
also has to ensure that market segments with fews firms remains
competitive and firms are not able to find opportunities to implicitly
collude through some extraneous means.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case IV:</strong> <span
class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}\rightarrow\infty$</span>: This is the
case of <strong>perfect competition</strong>. There are a large number
of infinitesimally small firms in the market with no market power. All
firms compete and drive down the prices to marginal cost, which is zero
because we assumed that there was no variable cost. Hence, all firms
make negative profits and either the market collapses or a small number
of firms find some extraneous means to erecting an artificial entry
barrier, i.e., increase <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>
through lobbying or corruption.</p>
<p>This is the reason why <em>constant returns to scale</em> is so
critical for <em>perfect competition</em>.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The
moment there is increasing returns to scale, the market either collapses
or you have an emergence of firms that can keep small challengers at bay
through some artificial means.</p>
<p><strong>Case V:</strong> <span
class="math inline">$\underline{n}&lt;\frac{M}{F}&lt;\bar{n}$</span>:
This is the range in which <strong>monopolistic competition</strong> can
potentially occur if certain other conditions on consumer preferences
(see below) are satisfied. The essence of monopolistic competition is
that number of firms <span class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}$</span> is
large enough so that they cannot strategically interact with each other,
i.e., obtain the benefits from oligopoly. Yet, the <span
class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}$</span> is small enough so that market
doesn’t collapse under the burden of perfect competition. As we will see
below, monopolistic competition is a very distinctive kind of
competition where consumer preference plays a critical role in
determining the number of firms in the market segment.</p>
<p>Adding the variable cost adds more complications and makes its more
realistic, but the basic insight about how increasing returns to scale
impacts market structure is retained through it.</p>
<h2 id="consumer-preferences">Consumer preferences</h2>
<p>While consumer preferences are irrelevant if either <span
class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}&lt;\underline{n}$</span> or <span
class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}\rightarrow\infty$</span>, consumer
preferences are of consequence in the intermediate range where
monopolistic competition occurs. The key parameter that matters in this
intermediate range is the consumer’s preference for variety, which
determines the consumer’s willingness to pay more for variety. <a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">$n=\frac{M}{F}$</span> firms in
the market segment. Each firm produces a new variety by sinking in the
cost <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>. The variety is
appropriate in narrow market segments and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> should be interpreted as a type of
good if thinking about broader market segments. <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is the size of the market, but as
the analysis becomes more complicated because the size of the market
itself is a function of <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span>.
This is intuitive. Apple iPhone increased the amount people spend on
phones dramatically, hence increasing the size of <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> by inventing a new product. It
drew in other firms and now the competition within a market segment is
defined by the size of the market and cost of inventing a new variety
(generation) of the smartphone, accounting of course for obsolesce. The
simple <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> model captures the insight of the
Dixit-Stiglitz-Krugman model.</p>
<p>A representative consumer’s utility derived from range a range of
<span class="math inline">$n=\frac{M}{F}$</span> differentiated goods is
given by <span class="math display">$$U=\left[\sum_{i}^{\eta}
x_i^{\rho}\right]^{\frac{1}{\rho}}$$</span> where <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em> ∈ {1, <em>n</em>}</span> represents the
range of differentiated goods and <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> denotes consumers’ preferences for
variety with.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If consumers have no taste for variety, i.e., <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em> = 1</span> then it leads to a linear
utility function <span
class="math display"><em>U</em> = <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>x</em><sub>2</sub> + … + <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>.</span>
This implies that goods are are perfect substitutes for the consumer. If
goods are perfect substitutes <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em> = <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>x</em><sub>2</sub> + … + <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>
then consumers will go for the cheapest one, which potentially triggers
a Bertrand competition amongst the producers and removes variety from
the market.</p>
<p>E.g., Market for wine in an area where people think all types of
wines are perfect substitutes for each other. In this market, the
cheapest wine ends up dominating the market. This is what happened to
most commodities markets in the past in places people didn’t care about
wheat or corn variety. Over time variety of wheat disappeared leaving us
with cheapest variety to produce, the one invented by Norman Borlaug at
the start of the Green revolution. A recent reversal of consumer
preference, largely triggered by increasing prevalence of intolerance to
gluten, has revived consumer preference for variety in wheat. As a
result, products made from certain old varieties of wheat like Spelt and
Khorasan are appearing back on the market shelves. Changes in <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> over time can collapse or revive a
differentiated products market segment.</p></li>
<li><p>If consumer have a very strong taste for variety i.e., <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em> → −∞</span> then it leads to a Leontief
Utility function <span
class="math display"><em>U</em> = min [<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>,…,<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>].</span>
This means that consumers perceive goods as perfect complements
production function. If goods are perfect complements, i.e., <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em> = min [<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>,…,<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>]</span>,
then they have to be consumed in fixed proportion, irrespective of their
price.</p>
<p>Broad categories like food, housing and transport are an example of
goods that are close to perfect complements are not that sensitive to
prices. While prices may change the type of goods or type of housing
people consume, there is complementarity between the broad
categories.</p></li>
<li><p>Monopolistic competition occurs in the intermediate case where
consumers have some taste for variety. That is if consumers perceive the
goods as either imperfect substitutes (or imperfect
complements).</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- - If there is no taste for variety in the consumers' preferences $(\rho\rightarrow{1})$ then it implies that consumers perceive all goods in a market segment as a perfect substitutes $(\sigma\rightarrow{\infty})$.
- If consumers perceive all goods in a market segment as a perfect complements $(\rho\rightarrow{0})$, then it implies consumers love variety $(\sigma\rightarrow{1})$..  -->
<p>What matters in monopolistic competition is that consumers are ready
to pay more for variety. In our parsimonious setup, <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> represents the cost of creating a
new variety. This captures the basic insight that creating a new variety
requires <em>innovation</em> generating a new idea, which makes the
production process exhibit <em>increasing returns to scale</em>. This
innovation or new idea is also a <em>non-rival good</em> and as we will
see below, it plays an important part in analysing any technological
change associated with climate change. The fact that consumers’ are
willing to pay variety implies the following four things.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It gives a firm an incentive to create a new variety.</p></li>
<li><p>The consumers pay so that firms can recover the cost of <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> and new varieties keep appearing
till consumers are no longer willing to collectively bear the cost of
creating another variety.</p>
<p>Since we are abstracting away from variable costs, the only cost that
matters is the total cost borne in creating variety. For <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> firms, this cost adds up to <span
class="math inline">$\sum_i^n{F}=nF$</span>. For all firms to break
even, the size of the market needs to be greater than the total cost
borne by the firms, i.e., <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em><em>F</em> &lt; <em>M</em></span>. In
equilibrium, the market would sustain <span
class="math inline">$n=\frac{M}{F}$</span> varieties.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>The size of the market is a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span>. The potential market <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is a function of consumer
preference for variety represented by <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span>, i.e., <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em> = <em>M</em>(<em>ρ</em>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Each firm has no market power over the whole market.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In equilibrium, the number of firms or number of differentiated
products <span class="math inline">$n=\frac{M(\rho)}{F}$</span> is
ultimately determined by <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>.</p>
<!-- In monopolistic competition, each producer sinks cost $F$ to create a new variety.  -->
<!-- Hence, it is consumers' taste for variety and $F$ that determines how many varieties there would be.

  -->
<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>The moment firms can exert market power through some means, it starts
becoming a strategic game between deep-pocket firms. Firms with
deep-pockets spend on advertising or lobbying to influence <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span>. Advertising increases <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> and the cost of advertising or
lobbying increases the <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>
required to be sunk in order to remain in the market. This decreases the
number of firms in the market segment.</p>
<p>This explains why the soft-drinks market, even though it should not
exhibit any increasing returns to scale, remains a duopoly. The
incumbents with deep pockets have been able to turn the soft drinks
market into an increasing return to scale production process, which in
turn allows them to earn oligopoly rents. They are quick to buy up firms
that threaten the duopoly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Innocent drinks that had the potential to change the soft drinks
market were bought up by Coco-cola in 2013.</li>
<li>The case of how Coke and Pepsi transformed the <a
href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51942067">Indian soft
drinks</a> market in the 1980s is the other example that illustrates
this. Before the entry of the deep pocket multinationals, the soft
drinks market in India had a huge variety. Within years of Coke and
Pepsi entering, the same market became a duopoly with all the other
firms being driven out. The consumers’ preference for variety did not
change suddenly, yet, the range of variety offered to them decreased
through an implicitly collusive strategy of the two firms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The upshot is that <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> can
either be exogenously high because of technology or can be increased if
some deep-pocket players within the market want to reduce competition in
the market. Whether that strategy succeeds or not largely depends on the
competition policy that is in place.</p>
<!--+ ## Junk

With consumer preference, $F$ is though of as cost of inventing a new differentiated product. If $\frac{M}{F}$ is high in a market segment, then there will be a lot of firms in the market. In this case, if consumers like variety, then they would be every spread their purchasing power over all the firms in the market. The question is how strong is their preference for variety, i.e., how much are they willing to pay for variety. If they are willing to pay for variety, that means $M$ will increase with variety, giving a new firms incentive to invent a new variety at cost $F$. Monopolistic competition says that the market structure results from interaction between consumer's taste for variety and increasing returns to scale (our $F$).

The monopoly and the perfect competition case is nested in this model. Perfect competition occurs if fixed cost is extremely low or if people are not willing to pay for variety. Similarly, monopoly occurs if either $F$ is very high or consumers have a very strong preference for something. E.g., Marmite.^[The increasing returns to scale could be due to technology or due to other factors like the cost of manipulating the consumer's preferences. Firms often spend a lot of manipulate people's preference through advertising and that becomes part of the $F$, i.e., if you don't spend $F$, you can't find you place in the market. Firms also spend a lot of money on buying away their competitors, which both increases $F$ and makes it easier to manipulate people's preference. A very interesting story about the market for soft drinks in India before multinationals enters and how they bought up all their rivals to create the usual duopoly in India so that only firms with deep pockets willing to fork up the high $F$ remained in the market.  +-->
<h1 id="demand-side">Demand Side</h1>
<p>The geo-engineering product described in the paper sounds like a pure
public good. It is both non-rival and non-excludable. Any public good
provision is in essence an <em>coordination game</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s think of a street with several houses. There is no street light
on the street and the local authorities refuse to put up the street
light. The street light, in this case, is pure public good because the
light from the street light is <em>non-rival</em> and
<em>non-excludable</em>. Each house can choose to either contribute
towards the street light or not contribute. Hence, it becomes a game
between the households living on the street on whether to contribute or
not and if they do, how much do they choose to contribute. There are two
possible case and I list the Nash equilibria in each case.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Private provision of public good</em>: One participant feels
so strongly that they are ready to self provide it and have the
resources to do so. They have such a strong preference for the street
light that they are ready to internalise the cost of paying for the
public good on their own.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> This is essentially a person with
<span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em> → −∞</span> who feels that the
street light is a pure complement to their other consumption goods. In
climate change movement one could think of Greta Thurberg or a dedicated
climate change NGO as having <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em> → −∞</span>.</p>
<p>This is also a <strong>unique Nash equilibrium</strong> because
knowing that there is someone on the street with a strong preference for
street light, it is optimal for all the other household not to
contribute.</p></li>
<li><p>Either no one participant feels so strongly about the street
light or the ones that do do not have the resources to contribute the
full amount. In this case, there is a good outcome that is not an
equilibrium and there is a bad outcome that is an equilibrium.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Good outcome:</em> There is an outcome where all houses
contribute towards the street light and benefit from the street light.
This is <strong>not a Nash equilibrium</strong> because if everyone else
is contributing, it is optimal for a household to deviate and not
contribute.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bad equilibrium:</em> No one contributes to the public good
and the public good is not provided. No household has an incentive to
deviate an contribute if no one else is contributing. This is the
<strong>unique Nash equilibrium</strong> in this case.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<!-- The good equilibrium is also the Pareto-optimal equilibrium and the bad equilibrium is also the Pareto sub-optimal equilibrium.  -->
<p>If there is no private provision of public good, pure public goods
require explicit coordination from the government so that the good
outcome can be attained. Alternatively, technology can be used to make
good excludable and create a private market from it.</p>
<p>Excludability is key to charging a price. Autoroutes in France is an
example of using technology to change the nature of the good and making
it excludable in order to create a private market for what is
essentially a public good. Yet, this private market competes with public
goods, i.e., other roads in France. What can be charged for this kind of
public good depends on how non-rival the non-excludable alternatives are
and consumer’s perceive substitutability between the two. In the case of
autoroutes, the other competing goods are the highways that run along
the autoroutes. If they are substitutes, no one would pay for
autoroutes. The autoroutes system has been specifically designed in such
a way that local roads are not a substitute for the autoroutes.</p>
<!-- The key to this is non-rivalry of the pure public good which competes with private good. It is very closely related to increasing returns to scale, i.e., sink the fixed cost $F$ and then every one can consume it without any rivalry in consumption.  -->
<p>If having a healthy global environment is considered critical, then
that means it complements other consumer goods. That implies that <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em> → −∞</span> for these broad categories of
goods, ie, environment and other consumer goods. If a country has a very
high <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span>, they would privately
provide the public good. This seems highly unlikely in the current
circumstances.</p>
<p>With <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em> → 1</span>, the bad
equilibrium is inevitable in the public goods game. The <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> the various governments across the
world have and how to change it is key debate about using increasing
returns to scale technology in solving the climate change policy.<a

<h1 id="upshot">Upshot</h1>
<p>I suspect a range of extremely high <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> climate change policies are stuck
in the <em>bad equilibrium</em> in spite of having a potential <span
class="math inline">$\frac{M}{F}&gt;1$</span> because the <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is price governments have to pay
and no one wants to pay it because of the coordination failure in the
public goods game.</p>
<p>Further, there is a debate about whether to provide it as a public
good or through market based measures. If geo-engineering is going to
compete with all the market oriented solutions then it is important to
pin down the efficacy of geo-engineering in terms of climate change
outcome variables and comparing it to other solutions. That requires
pinning down <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> and some proxy
for <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="krugman1987free">@krugman1987free</span> shows partly how
the <em>bad equilibrium</em> trap can be escaped. A highly scale
oriented industry with a very high <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is able to have two players in
spite of the fact that <span
class="math inline">$1&lt;\frac{M}{F}&lt;2$</span> because the
increasing returns to scale offers some externalities that countries can
capture and hence subsidise the high <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>.</p>
<h3 id="role-of-financial-markets">Role of Financial markets</h3>
<p>There is also an interesting story of how to finance a big <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> for increasing returns to scale
that have public goods attributes. <span class="citation"
data-cites="de1999development">@de1999development</span> makes the point
that (laissez-faire) decentralised banking system underinvests and under
transmits expertise. This is especially true if either <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is very high or the planning
horizon is very long. <span class="citation"
data-cites="de1999development">@de1999development</span> thus argues for
a development bank. There may be some merit to this idea for high <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> climate change mitigation
technology projects that have public goods characteristics.</p>
