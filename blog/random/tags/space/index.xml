      <description>Review of Space, Place, and Gender by Doreen Massey
Review of Taleb Book by Trevor on Goodreads 
review - interesting philosophy references  Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets | Nassim Nicholas Taleb
Yeah, you see. Iâ€™ve just checked and most of the other reviews of this book do pretty much what I thought they would do. They complain about the tone. This guy is never going to win an award for modesty and he probably thinks you are stupid and have wasted your life.</description>
