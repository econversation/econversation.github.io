      <description>Hugo Themes | Eureka
Getting Started
Preview Use the following command to preview the project in the browser:
hugo server  http://localhost:1313/docs/log/log/
Drafts will not be deployed by Hugo, so you need to set the draft property of the content header to false or use hugo server -D to preview the website. If you are not familiar with the basic usage of Hugo or want to know more about Hugo, you can refer to Hugo Basic Usage.</description>

      <description>Centering images in Hugo
... the solution
in the end, after some energetic googling i did cobble together something that gets the job done with minimal markup and no extraneous tags in the content.
to be able to center images in a Hugo-based blog or float them left/right (read: align left/right with text wrapping around them ), add the following to your CSS (typically under static/css/ on your side, or wherever the theme you’re using keeps its own stylesheets if you’re hacking the theme CSS directly):</description>

      <description>Lecture by George Freeman | Meeting Neville Ash
28 April 2022, 17:30
Lecture by George Freeman at Cambridge, organised by CSaP. He talked about the Government&amp;rsquo;s Integrated Science Review. His ambition is to make UK the Science Superpower. He had ambition of increasing the Science spending to European levels.
I asked him the following question. Given the lag between the spending and returns from growth in terms of taxes, isn&amp;rsquo;t it going to clash with the levelling up agenda.</description>

      <description>Michael Munger | Firms, Markets and transaction costs
 Michael Munger, Bosses Don’t Wear Bunny Slippers: If Markets are so Great, Why are there Firms?
Michael Munger is Chair of Political Science at Duke University.
Prices are the central force directing resources and shaping consumption in a market economy. But most economic activity seems (at first glance) to take place without any influence from prices at all.
 Most people work for a firm, a company, a large organization, and they have a boss.</description>

      <description>Topics: Universal Economics Book, Property rights, transaction,
 Podcast information David Henderson on the Essential UCLA School of Economics | Conversation Topicss
 Property Rights  The conversation begins with a discussion of Harold Demsetz&amp;rsquo;s 1967 AER article on property rights . Roberts and Henderson agree that this piece would both never be published in a top journal today, and that it remains a path-breaking contribution. What was so significant about this article? How do you think Demsetz’s notion of mutually beneficial exchange compares to the notion of euvoluntary exchange as put forth by Mike Munger?</description>

International standard paper sizes
by Markus Kuhn
Standard paper sizes like ISO A4 are widely used all over the world today. This text explains the ISO 216 paper size system and the ideas behind its design.
The ISO paper size concept
In the ISO paper size system, the height-to-width ratio of all pages is the square root of two (1.4142 : 1). In other words, the width and the height of a page relate to each other like the side and the diagonal of a square.</description>

      <description>Review of Space, Place, and Gender by Doreen Massey
Review of Taleb Book by Trevor on Goodreads 
review - interesting philosophy references  Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets | Nassim Nicholas Taleb
Yeah, you see. I’ve just checked and most of the other reviews of this book do pretty much what I thought they would do. They complain about the tone. This guy is never going to win an award for modesty and he probably thinks you are stupid and have wasted your life.</description>

      <description>The books on markets
From a goodreads review on Blue Ocean Strategy
The signal-to-noise ratio of business books generally tends towards zero. They fall into one of three categories:
 baked-over platitudes designed to reinforce the self-esteem of the reader (see First Break all the Rules), laughably faulty reasoning (see Good to Great) , and interesting ideas that are overextended and driven into the ground (see The Tipping Point).  There are a few good ideas in the book, but they are shrouded in unnecessary jargon and applied precariously to far too many companies.</description>

Python in TextMate 2
TextMate will parse the first line of your Python script for a shebang sequence.
... If found, it will attempt to call that interpreter when you run your script. I have installed Python 3 using homebrew, so the binary is in my /usr/local/bin folder. Lets set up a simple script and test this: #!/usr/local/bin/python3 print(&#39;hello, hypepat!&#39;)  .tm_properties
