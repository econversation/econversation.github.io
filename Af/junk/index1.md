The traditional modes of production in developing countries are usually intensive in labour and natural resources. At its very essence, the process of development requires replacing the traditional model of production with new more productive capital intensive modes of production. The knowledge workers require in the traditional sector and the modern sector differ greatly.

Over generations people accumulate a stock of knowledge on how to best combine their labour and natural resources available to them to produce goods that are essential for subsistence. The knowledge a traditional society has about utilising the natural capital available to them is often discounted in the language of the development literature. @kremer1993population is an exception in the endogenous growth literature. It models how the endogenous knowledge accumulation process helps increase the carrying capacity of the natural resources, i.e., allowing bigger populations to subsist using the natural resources. While a population may be adept at recognising the types of plants and the types of livestock, they are often alluded to unskilled workers. This is due to the implicit assumption that skills are associated with knowledge that complements the man-made or produced capital. 

With economic development, the capital-intensive modern sector expands and replaces the traditional sector.^[Further, if there are increasing returns to scale in the production in the modern sector, then the productivity of the size of the modern sector is determined by the market size.] The workers in the traditional sector need to choose between being skilled workers in the traditional sector and unskilled workers in the modern sector. The marginal productivity in modern sector has to be sufficiently high and the marginal productivity in the traditional sector sufficiently low for the worker to choose to switch. have to be sufficiently productive at the margin in order for them to make the switch lucrative. 


In Afghanistan, in spite of the aid it received, the modern sector never took off. Further, the traditional sector had a very lucrative crop in opium. While the US wanted farmers in the rural areas to replace opium with more traditional crops like wheat and other cereals. "*Since 2002 the US has spent nearly $9 billion on combating the drug trade, initially focused on compensated eradication, before trying to persuade farmers to switch to wheat and cereals*" [@faulkner2021afghan]

 

While the US wanted to eliminate the production of opium, the Taliban and other terrorist organisations exploited opium production.for its own purposes. @piazza2012opium finds that "*provinces that produce more opium feature higher levels of terrorist attacks and casualties due to terrorism, and that opium production is a more robust predictor of terrorism than nearly all other province features*". 




Can the modern sector remain capital intensive with the traditional sector remaining very labour intensive?
