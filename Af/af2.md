The traditional modes of production in developing countries are usually intensive in labour and natural resources. At its very essence, the process of development requires replacing the traditional model of production with new more productive capital intensive modes of production. The knowledge workers require in the traditional sector and the modern sector differs greatly.

Over generations, people accumulate a stock of knowledge on how to best combine their labour and natural resources available to them to produce goods that are essential for subsistence. The knowledge a traditional society has about utilising the natural capital available to them is often discounted in the language of the development literature. @kremer1993population models how the endogenous knowledge accumulation process helps increase the carrying capacity of the natural resources, i.e., allowing bigger populations to subsist using the natural resources. While a population may be adept at recognising the types of plants and the types of livestock, they are often alluded to as unskilled workers. This is due to the implicit assumption that skills are associated with the knowledge that complements the man-made or produced capital. 

With economic development, the capital-intensive modern sector expands and replaces the traditional sector.^[Further, if there are increasing returns to scale in the production in the modern sector, then the productivity of the size of the modern sector is determined by the market size.] The workers in the traditional sector need to choose between being skilled workers in the traditional sector and unskilled workers in the modern sector. The marginal productivity in the modern sector has to be sufficiently high and the marginal productivity in the traditional sector sufficiently low for the worker to choose to switch. have to be sufficiently productive at the margin in order for them to make the switch lucrative. 

In Afghanistan, despite the liberal foreign aid it has received, the modern sector never took off. Further, the traditional sector had a very lucrative crop in opium. While the Taliban allowed the rural provinces in the south of Afghanistan to continue with the production of opium, the US and its allies wanted farmers in the rural areas to replace opium with more traditional crops like wheat and other cereals. "*Since 2002 the US has spent nearly $9 billion on combating the drug trade, initially focused on compensated eradication, before trying to persuade farmers to switch to wheat and cereals*" [@faulkner2021afghan] Conversely, Taliban and other terrorist organisations exploited opium production for its own purposes. Taliban usually collected a 10% cultivation tax for opium [@bbc2021afghanistan]. Taliban also collected taxes from the whole supply chain, i.e., including laboratories processing opium into heroin and the traders who smuggle it.   

The US was initially successful in reducing the production of opium as well as the footprint of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The reduction was temporary and both the production of opium and the Taliban's presence increased with time. @piazza2012opium finds that "*provinces that produce more opium feature higher levels of terrorist attacks and casualties due to terrorism, and that opium production is a more robust predictor of terrorism than nearly all other province features*". 

Helmand province in the South of Afghanistan was both the stronghold of the Taliban and the province with the largest producer of opium.^[Helmand province is right next to the Kandahar province, the spiritual base of the Taliban.] Helmand was the site of the crucial battle between the US and its allies and the Taliban in 2008-09. The US and its allies were unable to displace the Taliban from Helmand province and it was the turning point in the war. The key reason the US and its allies were not able to displace the Taliban was that the Taliban had local support. Taliban grew in strength after the Helmand battle and the US reduced its footprint after 2012 leaving Helmand in the hands of the Taliban. It is quite likely that opium production is the key reason why the Taliban had local support and was able to survive in spite of the sustained pressure from the US and its allies.
