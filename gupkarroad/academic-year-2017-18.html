<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6</span> Controversy surrounding delivery of ENVS1006<a href="academic-year-2017-18.html#controversy-surrounding-delivery-of-envs1006" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>There was utter confusion around teaching ENVS1006. ENVS1006 was the first year Economics course for undergraduates at CPM. The controversy largely erupted due to the different instructions Xuxin Mao and I were getting about the course ENVS1006 was supposed to be run. Dr Coffman had asked me to help improve the course. Dr. Aeli Roberts was asking Xuxin Mao to resist any changes to the course and setting him on collision path with me.</p>
<p>Xuxin Mao was the module leader of ENVS1006 and had carefully planned the course over the summer. Then on 20 September 2017, for reasons that is difficult to comprehend, Dr Coffman asked me to get involved in the course and help improve it without clearly specifying who will do what. Course need to be planned well in advance and making changes to the course at this late stage is a recipe for disasters.</p>
<p>The emails below describe the chaos the ensued. I have not even completed a month at CPM, so I was entirely unaware of how things ran. I was also under a great stress due to seemingly long list of errands Dr Coffman had handed me to do that seemed entirely unrelated to my job descriptions. Further, I was very concerned that there had been no paper trails of all the things I had been asked to do. I was still commuting 5 hours a day from Cambridge due to the inordinate delay in UCL giving me a contract that would enable me to rent a house. I also trying to house hunt at the same time. Some of the emails reflect this stress and frustation. The controversy lasted a week and it became clear to me that Xuxin Mao was simply being bullied and harassed by Dr Coffman and Dr Aeli Roberts after the email dated 11 October 2017 (10:34:35 BST) from Dr Coffman where she said <qt>No worries. I think my last email should remove any doubt about where this is coming from. He may be scared of me, but I think he’s more scared of Aeli.</qt>. It slowly dawned on my that what Dr Coffman had said was literally true and Xuxin was actually really scared. In retrospect, I am regret the week we spent argue but I am also reassured with the thought that I did my best to support him in teaching hence forth. This is reflected in the mutual warmth in the subsequent email. I also spent time help him improve his teaching technique and helping in any way that I could.</p>
<ul>
<li>The emails are more ominous in retrospect with the knowledge that within months Dr Coffman started preparing a case against Xuxin Mao to fire him.</li>
<li>I was asked by Dr Coffman in my second probation meeting on 12 December 2017 if I had any evidence that would help her build a case to fire Xuxin Mao. She at that stage told me that she had learnt something from her Editor’s network that would help her build a case against Xuxin Mao.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was utter confusion around teaching ENVS1006. Different people were giving different directions to Xuxin Mao and me and the ambiguity in directions created a very difficult to working relationship between Xuxin Mao and me. Reading this after 4 years makes me extremely uncomfortable</p>
<ul>
<li>Xuxin Mao had been put in a impossible situation by Dr Coffman and Dr Aeli Roberts. I regret the part I unwittingly played in it.</li>
<li>Within weeks of this conversation, Xuxin Mao and I realised that we had been given contradictory information by Dr. Aeli Roberts and Dr Coffman and our disagreement came from the differing objectives we had been given.</li>
<li>We went one to become good friends and colleagues with mutually affection and admiration as the later email show.</li>
<li>Xuxin was extremely diffident about delivering lectures in English. I had done a lot of training at LSE to improve my public speaking skills I had started teaching at LSE as a PhD student. I did my best to teach him techniques I had learnt at LSE.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I understand it, the key issue was that Xuxin had prepared the course as a “Construction Economics” course over the summer and had previously got instructions that he was going to deliver the whole course on his own from Dr Aeli Roberts, the Head of the Undergraduate programme. Conversely, Dr Coffman had instructed me to design and deliver a first year “Microeconomics” course. Unfortunately, Dr Coffman had not discussed this arrangement with Xuxin, the module leader for the course and was sending instructions to him through me. The whole issue arose because Dr Aeli Roberts was giving Xuxin Mao instructions that contradicted the instructions Dr Coffman was giving me. At this point, I had been working at UCL for about 3 weeks and had never met or spoken to Dr. Aeli Roberts. All instructions the seemed ad hoc and off the cuff and there was no formal process through which these decisions were made. As the Head of the Undergraduate programme, it was Dr Aeli Roberts who was responsible for ensuring that the course runs smoothly. Yet, she remained strangely silent through this whole debacle.</p>

<p>The computer is easy to fix. Michael needs to order a new one. We have plenty of cash! Computers are like expensive calculators. They break. We buy new ones. We shouldn’t be fixing them unless it’s a configuration issue.</p>
<p>As for your desk, just tell the computer guy no. He has no right to do that, nor does anyone else. Just tell them to find a different solution:</p>

<p>Dear Aniket</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you if you could act as a third supervisor providing a more general support to Lois (a PhD students in behavioural economics and supervised by Michelle Baddeley and Xuxin.</p>
<p>Michelle can explain a bit more what your role could be but the idea is mostly that Lois feels integrated in the department and gets the right advice, i.e. conferences, how to engage with all of us, the academics and the PhD students, and more general topics. It will also enable you to have a supervisory track record and eventually be first supervisor.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Dear Kumar</p>
<p>Thanks very much for this, which is indeed very helpful. I’ve passed it along to my co-organisers of the conference in October. Since this is up your street, I am hoping that you’ll be able to help them write content for the conference brochure and also to assist possibly with the creation of a short video framing the discussion. Please liaise with Adrian about this as I will be away the 5th to 25th of October. I’ve also attached the draft of the programme.</p>

<p>As you may have gathered from D’Maris’ email, I am joining Bartlett as
a Research Fellow in September. D’Maris suggested that I could help in
the brochure and the video. Just wondering if we could have a chat
about how I can help the brochure, video or the organisation of the

<p>Hi Ahmed,</p>
<p>The reference are below. As you will see, even though the two papers are not directly connected, when you put them together the puzzle of uneven growth becomes clear. There are no papers on public capital at least in the sense that I was talking about. I do have an early draft on it but it is rather preliminary.</p>

<p>Good morning, Kumar.</p>
<p>If you are still available to meet earlier over lunch, we could do that; my lunch plan fell through. Otherwise, see you at 2:30pm as planned.</p>
<p>A few options would be the cafe across the street, the outdoor stalls on Tottenham Court Road and the benches by them, a S Korean by Tottenham Court Road. There are a number of restaurants in Fitzrovia (I’m unfamiliar with them). Further away, there’s a cafe in Russell Square, or, if you don’t mind a 20 minute walk each way, I could show you London House, Goodenough College, a hall of residence for postgrad full-time Commonwealth and US students supported by the Queen.</p>

<p>Dear Imad,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had something in Cambridge this morning and I just saw this. The thing ran a bit late, so I am just getting on a later the train to London, which means that we would have to meet a bit later, so it would more likely be 2:45PM. Apologies for that and see you soon.</p>

<p>Dear Kumar,</p>
<p>I just got the chance to look at the slides to be delivered next Monday.
This is a outstanding lecture note. I really appreciate your efforts that you have made.</p>
<p>However, I am concerned about how ENVS 1006 is being delivered.</p>
<p><qt>We should follow the syllabus more closely, which means microeconomics first and then macroeconomics.</qt>
And we definitely need to combine construction examples with economic principles, which means the construction economics text book needs to be used.</p>
<p><qt>If we do not follow it, it will give students conflicting information. I know it is too late to change the week 8 contents,</qt> but I do hope that we can catch up after your lecture so that we get consensus first before we delivering any more contents.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Xuxin</p>

<p>Dear Xuxin,</p>
<p>I have been very upset that you have wasted a lot of my time and effort by making me buy the Meyer book and trying to make me teach something that is impossible to teach. You have no idea how much time I have wasted in the last few weeks trying to work out how to reconcile modern Economics with Micro. <qt>You have also given me the wrong impression that you were going to design the course and I just had to follow it. This is not what D’Maris had in mind. I have had a chat with D’Maris and she made it clear that she wants me to design the course the way I think is appropriate.</qt> You may like to clear that up with D’Maris if you like.</p>
<p>What I am teaching is Micro - the way it is taught in the best Economics departments in the world. Institutions, inequality, social contracts, firms and consumer choice are all interlinked. After all, how can you unlink consumer choice from institutions or firm choices from property rights? I have been teaching Micro, Macro, Development Economics, Political Economy, International Trade for more than 15 years now. So, I think I know what Micro is.</p>
<p>What you are talking about is Samuelson Micro, which is no longer taught. I cannot in good conscientious teach something that is no longer considered correct. You are welcome to look the syllabus of Faculties around the world and if you find that I am wrong, I am happy to discuss it.</p>
<p>If you are concerned, I am happy to defend my plan with a meeting with D’Maris. You are welcome to take over the whole course and teach it just the way you want to. But, if I am going to teach it, it is going to be the modern way.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Kumar,</p>
<p>Thanks for your email. However, please do keep our future email exchanges in a friendly and mutually respecting tone.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your efforts and am very thankful to you for delivering microeconomics based on your fantastic teaching experiences.</p>
<p>I agree that there is improvement to be made for this module. Given the module contents have long been set in the undergraduate handbook and briefed to students during the introduction and first teaching week, <qt>if changes have to be made, we need to discuss them properly with the students and undergraduate course leader Dr Aeli Roberts and administrator Ms Katerina Taka.</qt></p>
<p>By the way, the book cost can be reimbursed via our department as I informed you before you purchased Meyers (2016) Construction Economics which I still think is a very good book with actual construction examples.</p>
<p>As we discussed, we can adopt economic principles from the <a href="http://www.core-econ.org/" class="uri">http://www.core-econ.org/</a> text book and construction examples from Meyers (2016), which I do not see why it is not unteachable.
I hope you understand that I only want to deliver a good economics module together with you for students in construction project management not ones in an economics department. I am not against changes nor modern economics, but things have to be done following proper procedures.</p>
<p>Given the week 8 contents were updated on Sunday, they should be delivered for the coming Monday lecture. We then should definitely arrange a meeting to put things forward smoothly based on necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Xuxin</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’ve seen the Myers (2016) book but is it really teaching Samuelson micro? On what rationale? It’s very difficult to use the construction examples if the micro theory is wrong unless you just extract short readings on Moodle and don’t make them buy the book. I’ve only ever taught Macro to them but I really did intend for Aniket to teach micro and Xuxin to teach macro as they wish. It’s great if the content is coordinated, but if they disagree, it’s up to each individual lecturer.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, the course needs to be tailored to construction management students, but intro micro also needs to be taught correctly. It’s a course taught everywhere, not just in economics departments but in politics, development studies, international relations, law, business, etc. No one teaches Samuelson any longer and it’s a real problem if they did because micro-founded macro needs a correct base. I’m reluctant to wade in on content but can someone show me a copy of this book since one of you is claiming it’s wrong. In the absence of that, i am concerned with academic freedom and Aniket is teaching micro and Xuxin macro.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Xuxin</p>
<p>I will look at this, but I suspect it wasn’t even that current in 2004 when it was first published. Routledge can be pirates this way, and it’s particularly concerning because there is very little else called ‘Construction Economics’ out there. Most of what is available otherwise is for QS courses or at the BTEC level. Has anyone looked at Gerard de Valence’s book for the future? He’s a visiting prof with us and the intro to his text has a v good discussion of what CE is and isn’t.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

<p><qt>Look Xuxin, it is very clear, you did not give me a say in designing the course. You made the syllabus without consulting me without involving me.

That is not going to work. I am a Research Fellow and teaching is not my job. I am happy to teach but trying to work out things with you is taking too much time and I can’t afford that.</qt> You seem to be stuck in your position and not ready to accommodate. I am happy to teach but only when I am given a say in the course. If you are going to tell me every week what I should be doing, then that is unacceptable to me.</p>
<p><qt>If you are ready to be professional in your conduct with me and respect my professional expertise, then I am happy to be friendly.

<p>Dear Xuxin</p>
<p>Given the apparent impasse with Aniket over the content of the Micro half, I think it would be better if we swapped and you did Micro and he does Macro, designed to his own specifications, in the spring. Because he’s already taught a couple Micro classes, you will need to first mark all the exams in the spring and he can second mark them to maintain parity of workload. Beyond that, you will need to coordinate with him on the draft exams, including the resit exam. For the avoidance of doubt, although you are the titular module leader, he is entitled to academic freedom to teach what he sees fit, and we have no right or ability to insist he teach to an existing syllabus in which he had little or no input. I understand that you imagined he would be agreeable to slotting into a course that you had designed (because it means less work for him), but you have to respect the fact that he’s not comfortable teaching the material you set.</p>
<p><qt>Beyond that, Aeli and I have concerns about the Myers textbook</qt> (that it’s too simplistic and not sound economics) and, in fact, Myers was not well-received when he gave a talk at CPM years ago. So I think this is probably a regrettable choice of text, and think you should talk to Gerard when he arrives in November about his own text. But in any case, we can re-think teaching provision for first-year undergrad next year given the pending replacement of Alex’s post with a lectureship.</p>
<p>All best</p>

<p>Dear D’Maris,</p>
<p>Thanks for your email.</p>
<p><qt>I think it is good for me and Aniket to meet later this week so that we can inform you, Aeli, Katerina and students the final changes as soon as possible.</qt></p>
<p>One thing has to be <qt>clarified is that the course was designed and submitted to handbook well before Dr Aniket jointed our school, with its contents already briefed to students.</qt> With more coordination and better communication, I firmly believe the misunderstandings happened for the past few weeks should be avoided.</p>

<p>Dear Xuxin</p>
<p>How can the course have been briefed to students before the start of term? Aniket joined on 4 September well before students arrived. You knew from the workload model you were teaching with him. You really should have taken on board his feedback. I am not going to ask him to teach material that he thinks is not accurate or pitched at the right level, especially when Aeli and I have our own doubts about Myers. I was trying to reduce your fall workload and spare you two preps, but you’ve made that impossible now because Aniket does not want to teach a course that he thinks is badly designed and unsound analytically. That is his choice. The upside is hst you now get the spring to concentrate on your research.</p>
<p>You didn’t run the course by anyone else on the econ and finance team from what I can see. That is your call, but UCL respects academic freedom and you must do so as well. Please take over Micro and let him redesign Macro as he sees fit. We can see at the end which was more effective at meeting students needs and interests.</p>
<p>All best</p>

<p>Dear D’Maris,</p>
<p>Thanks for your detailed explanations!</p>
<p>The <qt>course contents were briefed to students in the induction week. I first met Aniket on 20 September and there should have been more discussions to fix any later problems.</qt></p>
<p>If Aniket does not reject, I will take on Microeconomics this year and he on macroeconomics. I will schedule a meeting with him so that we can keep working on our contents while co-designing final exam papers.</p>

<p>Dear Aniket and Xuxin</p>
<p>I’m waiting for Philip to be seen by the GP, but I think that is the best solution. Xuxin takes over Micro, Aniket takes over Macro next term. The two of you will need to co-create a common exam and common resit exam, but otherwise are free to run your halves as you see fit.</p>

<p>Dear Aniket,</p>
<p>I am writing to invite you for a quick discussion this afternoon at my office Room 251 about announcement to make to the students on changes related to ENVS1006.</p>
<p>Attached is the module description set in summer for the 2017-2018 course handbook well before you came here (I sent it to you during our first meeting last month). My initial syllabus aims to deliver the contents. Accordingly, any changes we are going to make may not deviate too much from module description. If we have to make them, <qt>subject to agreements from Aeli,</qt> we should inform students as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I am at my office today until 6pm. If you are not available, we can find some time tomorrow before or after our group meeting.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Xuxin</p>

<p>Dear Xuxin</p>
<p>In my experience, you are assessed mostly on whether or not the course is dynamic and whether students think it sets them up for success in their other courses. I can appreciate why you are concerned giving the marks you got last year, but I don’t think you need to worry about students pulling out the course handbook and assessing the course against it. These are first year students after all. I think what you need to do is improve your classroom-based teaching through the UCL Arena process. Please book a time with Leo to come talk to me about this but do not use your submission to the handbook over the summer as a basis for dictating content to Aniket. Very many courses are co-taught and adjustments are made during the Teaching Resource Committees over the summer, and content changes as a result. We have no evidence, empirically or anecdotally, that students ever punish staff in their assessments on this divergence.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>During the Christmas break, we have received students’ request on weekly (optional) tutorial sessions. Meanwhile, I received some students’ request for me to continue lecturing this term.</p>
<p>If you do not mind, I can keep lecturing the macroeconomic sections this term with weekly tutorial sessions. I will be very happy to discuss with your suggested arrangements via email or my number 07404490133.</p>
<p>Thanks and look forward to meeting you sometime soon!</p>

<p>Hi Xuxin,</p>
<p>Happy New Year to you too!!! Hope you had a good break.</p>
<p>When I spoke to Aeli in December, she had told me that you are going to continue lecturing with Macro this term. I would be very happy for you to continue with Macro whole of this term if would like. This would also provide continuity for the student, especially given that I am away for two week in March for my wedding. I have also heard from the students that they are really enjoying your lectures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you would like me to take over Macro, I could certainly do that. Though, it may be in student’s best interest if they have continuity with you especially now that they have formed a relationship with you.</p>
<p>Let me know what works best for you. I am happy to do whatever works best for you. I am on 07596971143 in case you would like to talk.</p>

<p>I sent off my comments to both Alex and Xuxin this evening. My apologies for being late on this. </p>
<p>Alex’s paper was absolutely fine, so I did not have much to contribute. Xuxin’s paper require quite careful reading and rephrasing. I have sent him. detailed comments. It required a lot of reframing and that is why it got delayed. I had not expected that it will take a whole day and half. I will sit down with Xuxin this week and discuss and hopefully agree the changes. Hope that is OK! </p>
<p>Best wishes, 
Aniket</p>

<p>Hi Aniket,</p>
<p>Communications within the School as not as efficient as we’d like to think they are so I was not aware of your joining us until D’Maris explained to me who you are yesterday afternoon.
I think we should meet sometime soon (how about Monday next week?) to catch up, especially since you will be contributing to IIF teaching.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />
Aris</p>

Subject: Digging the Dirt at Public Expense - paper by Engerman and Sokoloff</code></pre>
<p>I read a rather interesting infrastructure paper by Engerman and Sokoloff (2006) this week. The paper looks at planning and construction of the Erie Canal (1817-1825), the first big infrastructure project in the US. The paper finds that compared to the 11 other large infrastructure projects the US has implemented since, Erie Canal was well conceived and executed with a cost-overrun ratio of just 1.46. In contrast, the cost-overrun ratio of Mississippi River Levee Line (1883-1926) was 20, Interstate highways (1952-53) was more than 19.1 and Boston Central Artery/Tunnel (1991-2004) was 5.21.</p>
<p>The really interesting bit in the paper is how this engendered growth subsequently in the US, which is related Krugman’s (1991) history versus expectations argument. The paper is also related to the literature on the localised historical shock (Davis and Weinstein, 2002, 2008; Miguel and Roland, 2011) and the literature on sub-contracting (Banerjee and Duflo, 2000; McMillan and Woodruff, 1999) and the local public good literature (Miguel, Gugerty, 2005; Ghani et al., 2016)</p>
<p>Happy to chat further on this if anyone in interested in these areas or papers.</p>

<p>Dear Aris,</p>
<p>Sorry, we have not met so far. I have been figuring out the school and it is taking time to get to grips with it and meet everyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on Monday I am at The London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance for the Unconventional monetary policy conference. The conference is going to run all day and finishes around 6 PM. If you are still around after that, I could pop back to CPM after the conference.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I will be at the leaving drinks for Kamran this evening. If you plan to be there, maybe, we could have a chat. If not, I am there on Wednesday all day and we could meet if you have time.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Prof. Penn,</p>
<p>My apologies for bothering you. I am a new Research Associate in Economics at CPM and I have been trying to build a research project that 1) critically examines some of the assumptions in Economic models and 2) tries to incorporate experiential space in Economic models. The somewhat ambitious objective at this stage is to use game theory to understand how the constructed space intermediates human to human interaction and how social norms emerge as a result of this spatial interaction.</p>
<p>A number of colleagues at CPM have suggested that my work is related to space syntax. Given how busy you remain, I have hesitated in approaching you until now and have finally picked up the courage to do so. If you ever have a moment to spare, I would really benefit from your guidance.</p>
<p>A colleague and I have recently submitted a research proposal to ESRC’s Rebuilding Macroeconomics initiative where we set out how we want to embed endogenous space in an economic growth model. I have attached the proposal. It sets how where we are in terms of our ideas right now.</p>
<p>Again, my apologies for taking up your time with this.</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br>
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Prof. Penn,</p>
<p>Since our conversation, I have been working on developing a framework that can be taken to data to understand why pocket of under-development emerge in the developed countries. The literature turned out to be vast and took me a long time to get a sense of. My apologies that it has taken me so long to send you something on it.</p>
<p>The short note desribes the model I have tried  to solve.
<a href="http://www.aniket.co.uk/research/Aniket_Desert.pdf">http://www.aniket.co.uk/research/Aniket_Desert.pdf</a>
There are still bits that need work, but I just wanted to see if you thought I was headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>The note sets out a model based on Krugman 1980 where the number of varieties available is an endogenously determined. I have tried to model the role supermarkets play in the rural area by using a game called the Chain-store paradox.</p>
<p>The model solves out to explain why pockets of depriviation emerge where people in deprived areas consume everything  that is produced in other locations. There are a number of very interesting papers on “food deserts” in US and if I am not wrong, the model in the note may shed some light on why they emerge. The model is still very rough. So, my apologies if it does not read smoothly. If you have some time at some point, I could quickly talk you through the model.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br>
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Kumar</p>
<p>I won’t be in until very late on Monday (around 3pm). So Michael will sort out the induction, including arranging for an access card and email and other IT accounts. He will also order a laptop. Your desk won’t be available until next Monday as Sulafa Badi is leaving for Dubai on Friday. So for the first week you can use one of the hot desk machines in Room 249 until you’re able to move in. I will be in on Tuesday and would like to meet you around 10.0 in my office (room 333). Look forward to catching up.</p>
<p>All best</p>
