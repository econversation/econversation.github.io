Link to the job Description While the job description only mentions research, it is striking that it does not mentions any teaching. Dr Coffman and Helen Pascoe have continued to insist for the last two years that my job description includes a significant teaching load. I have asked them for the job description on file a number of times, but they have never provided me the job description on file. 24 Jul 2017 Job interview at CPM. Link to the my job interview presentation. 25 Jun 2017 Offered the job. 25 Jun 2017 Dr Coffman immediately start asking me to do time-consuming errands as described in the section Errands for Dr Coffman’s before starting the job at UCL below. 11 Sep 2017 Official start date as a Research Associate at UCL, according to the employment contract. It is also the start of my 9 month probation period. 12 Sep 2017 First meeting with Dr Coffman my line manager. I expected a list of objectives in line with my job descriptions. In stead, it is an informal chat where Dr Coffman asked me to do what seemed like list of personal errands. These were apart from helping organise the Skills conference, to do some teaching on her behalf and supervise two of her PhD students because she did not have time to do so. I was also supposed to coordinate with Xuxin Mao on teaching the first year Construction Economics course as described in the section titled Controversy surrounding delivery of ENVS1006. After waiting all of August for the contract, I still did not have an official contract, which meant I could not start looking for accommodation in London. My rental lease in Cambridge was up and no one at CPM had any idea when I would get my contract and when I could move to London. Having been on a number of hiring committees in Cambridge and Edinburgh, I knew the best practice is making sure that contract is offered well in advance so that the new person can be well settled before they start the job. 21 Sep 2017 My UCL employment contract is issued. Link to my employment contract It allows me to start looking for accommodation in London. Till I find accommodation in London, I have to continue to commute everyday from Cambridge. It is exhausting and takes about 5 hours a everyday. 21 Oct 2017 Email from Dr Coffman asking me to write a textbook on Construction Economics. 03 Oct 2017 Cover teaching for Dr Coffman. It was a 6 hour long session. Dr Coffman provide not lecture material and I prepared the lecture on my own. As I understand, it was attributed to Dr Coffman and it was never recorded as work I had done. Here is a link to my lecture. More details in section below. 10 Oct 2017 Start of the Controversy surrounding delivery of ENVS1006 as described in the section below. 1 Nov 2017 I am able to move to London, which reduces my commute time considerably. 3 Nov 2017 Email Dr Coffman asking for help, given that I did not have a proper desk or access to a functioning computer. I would often arrive at work to see that someone had decide to take over my desk. It is difficult to describe the chaos that prevailed in CPM at that stage where a person has to beg and plead for even the most basic things that are standard in most academic environment. 9 Nov 2017 I am finally able to get the CPM to order a computer for me. It is also clear not everyone is equal at CPM and how you are treated depends on your position in the power structure. For someone lower down the food-chain, even getting access to the basic necessity like a laptop is a struggle. 23 Nov 2017 Email from Stani asking me to get involved with supervising a Phd student. 28 Nov 2017 I finally get access to a functioning computer. 12 Dec 2017 Three month probation meeting with Dr Coffman. There is minutes or paperwork in the meeting. 18 April 2018 6 month Probation Meeting where I was given a new set of objectives and made to sign a probation form that was backdated to 11 Sep 2017. This form did not reflect that work I had done till 18 April 2018 on Prof Coffman’s direction. 11 Jun 2018 End of probation meeting where Prof. Coffman extended my probation. 24 July 2018 I email the Dean Prof Alan Penn asking him if I could see him and discuss my research with him. 22 Aug 2018 After pursuing her for months, Dr. Coffman finally agreed me to see and talk to me about a Research proposal I had submitted in July 2018. 5 Sep 2018 I got the letter confirming that I had completed my probation. Letter to confirm end of probation 1.1.2 Errands for Dr Coffman’s before starting the job at UCL Date Description 25 Jul 2017 Email from Dr D’Maris Coffman (Senior Lecturer and Interim Director of CPM) offering me the job of Research Associate in Economics and Finance of the Built Environment. My email reply to Dr Coffman asking for details about my job. No response to me question. 26 Jul 2017 My follow up email to Dr Coffman adding details to my earlier email. No response to my question. 31 Jul 2017 Phone call from Dr Coffman followed by an email asking me write a note on skill shortage in UK for somebody called John McKenna. My email sending John McKenna my note on skill shortage in UK. Link to the note I wrote for John McKenna on skill shortage. 01 Aug 2017 Email from Dr Coffman asking me to help Adrian Williamson organise a conference in October 2017. The tasks Adrian Williamson set me were time consuming. I had to balance that task with my full time job at Cambridge University at Director of Studies and Lecturer at Murray Edwards College and Newnham College. It was odd that I was given so much to do even before the UCL contract has been issued. 01 Aug 2017 Email from Dr Coffman asking me to review a paper for the journal Structural Change and Economic Development (SCED). Dr Coffman is the editor for SCED. As an editor Dr Coffman has asked me to referee 29 papers in the last three years. There is short supply of referees in Economics. Given that Economics papers are usually 50 pages long, it usually takes about 2 days to read and write a good referee report for an Economics paper. No editor in Economics would ever ask anyone to referee the amount Dr Coffman has asked me to referee. She has clearly used the leverage she has over me as my line-manager and Director of CPM to get me to referee such a large number of papers. 08 Aug 2017 Dr Coffman’s email reply to my questions about the conference and asking me to review another paper for SCED. It seems clear that questions about my role at CPM is not going to be answered. My job for now is to do backend work for a conference and referee a steady stream of papers for the journal Dr Coffman is edits. 09 Aug 2017 Email where Adrian Williamson details that tasks he has allocated to me for the conference. The tasks includes getting an overview of the conference and write the introduction as well as help to produce the video for the conference. 10 Aug 2017 Email from Niamh Ryan (CPM Communication Manager) asking me to help with the video for the conference. 27 Aug 2017 I complete all the tasks Adrian Williamson had set for me for the conference. Writing the introduction for a conference brochure required going through all the papers submitted for the conference and trying to get a sense of what the conference was trying to achieve was an arduous task. Adrian Williamson and Dr Coffman had provided me very little contextual information for the conference. I spend approximately 15 working days completing all the tasks Adrian Williamson had set for me. Dr Coffman is on vacation through most of August and there is no communication with her. I had to prepare the conference brochure and help with the video while I was trying to wind up all the loose ends and hand over the jobs at Cambridge that I had held for 10 years. I the Director of Studies for Murray Edwards College and Newnham College. I had served on the the Murray Edwards College Council for 4 years (2013-2017), the body that manages the Council on a day to day basis. I was also a trustree of Murray Edwards College. As Member of the College Council and trustee, I had been member of numerous Committees and was privy a lot of confidential material. Properly dealing with all the confidential material and handing over all the administrative roles assigned to me in a responsible way was in itself a full time job. Being at the beck and call of Adrian Williamson was extremely difficult, especially, since I had no idea who he was and what gave him the authority to behave like my line-manager even before I had received a formal contract from UCL, let alone start the job. 05 Oct 2017 Spent the whole day attending the Skills conference I had helped organise. 1.1.3 Personal errand: Delivering lecture for Dr Coffman Date Description 14 Sep 2017 Email from Dr. Coffman asking me to fill-in for a day long lecture for IF3 on 2 Oct 2017. Dr. Coffman did not provide any lecture material. Dr Coffman suggested a long list of topics to be covered (auction theory, market structure, path dependence, transaction costs and supply chain problems, etc) asked me to design the lecture around a particular that I was not familiar with. Quote from the email: “I’ll send a syllabus for IF3 around shortly but as this is the first week, it would be helpful for you to get cracking on learning the game itself.” Dr Coffman never sent me the syllabus for IF3. Neither did she provide me with any lecture slides. I took it as a signal that I needed to prepare the session from scratch. Understanding the game and preparing a lecture based on her short brief took a long time. This is especially because the topics she suggested are extremely complex and counter-intuitive and usually are covered over a term in any Microeconomics course in Economics Department. The key problem was that while results can be intuitive when markets work well, when markets don’t work, the analysis gets extremely complex and a lot of results are counter-intuitive and required careful learning arc. It is part of well-established pattern where Dr. Coffman asks someone to cover her teaching and then does not provide the lecture material forcing them to do all the preparation for the lecture. There are a number of PhD students who have complained about this bitterly in private but are fear the retaliation if they spoke against Dr. Coffman. In fact, there is PhD student would be ready to attest to this if her anonymity is guaranteed. 15 Sep 2017 My reply to Dr Coffman 29 Sep 2017 Aris Pantelias (Head of IIF3 Programme) accidentally found out that I had joined CPM and seemed surprised to realise that I was lecturing on IF3. Email from Aris suggesting a meeting to chat about my lecture for IF3. Quote from the email: “Communications within the School as not as efficient as we’d like to think they are so I was not aware of your joining us until D’Maris explained to me who you are yesterday afternoon. I think we should meet sometime soon (how about Monday next week?) to catch up, especially since you will be contributing to IIF teaching.” 18 days into the job, I was unfamiliar with CPM’s internal structure and no one had told me that Aris was the head of IIF Programme. This made my meeting with Aris extremely awkward. I met Aris at a CPM drinks event in the evening. As learnt over time, Aris was a very meticulous person. He was visibly uncomfortable that someone who he knew nothing about was lecturing on his programme. Not knowing his connection to the programme, I was not sure why he was asking me all the question about the lecture. In fact, if Dr Coffman had put me in touch with Aris from the start, it would have made my life much easier and helped me prepare the session. I subsequently learnt that Aris was very agitated to learn that Dr Coffman had yet again palmed-off her teaching to someone else. Aris and I shared a commitment to teaching and always putting the interests of students ahead of everything else and came to know each other well before he was pushed out/made to leave of CPM a few months later. 03 Oct 2017 Link to my lecture filling-in for Dr Coffman. The whole session was a 6 hours long. Explaining auctions or path dependence is challenging in any course, let alone in one session with a game where the students’ learning arc was a mystery to me. After some thought, I designed a lecture based around the First and Second Welfare theorem that gave a context to auctions and other contract based transactions. 1.1.4 Supervising Dr Coffman’s PhD Students Date Description Dr Coffman had asked me to supervise two PhD students of hers because she said that she did not have the time to supervise them. 23 Sep 2017 Met Imad Ahmed, Dr Coffman’s PhD student who she had asked me to supervise because she did not have time to do so. Imad seemed uncomfortable with the meeting and my undefined role to supervise on behalf of Dr Coffman. There was a particularly difficult discussion about Principal-Agent model he was using in his dissertation. Email exchange with Imad Ahmed about the supervision meeting Dr Coffman had asked me to do. 12 Oct 2017 Met Tehreem Husain, Dr Coffman’s other PhD student who she had asked me to supervise because she did not have time to do so. Email exchange with Dr Coffman about the meeting with Tehreem where Dr Coffman says “And thanks for looking after my PhD students as I don’t really have time to do justice to them at the moment. ;)” . I had never across such an arrangement in my two decades in UK academia. While I was happy to talk to the students informally if the student sought me out, I was very uncomfortable with an arrangement where Dr Coffman wanted to delegate the task of supervision to me because she didn’t have time. The students also expressed their unhappiness with the arrangement. I could see a pattern when I being exploited as a minion, being asked to do things as personal favour, which had nothing to do with my job description. 1.1.5 Research Work with Prof Jim Meikle Date Description 12 Sep 2017 First meeting with Prof Jim Meikle (Professor in Construction Economics, CPM) to talk about research. 26 Sep 2017 Email from Jim Meikle discussing a potential paper on road construction initiative in Bihar that I had told him about. 17 Oct 2017 Email from Jim Meikle asking me to send Dr Coffman and him and short outline on paper on Bihar road construction initiative. Link to the short outline I sent Dr Coffman and Jim in response to their email. 18 Oct 2017 My talk at the Economic and Finance seminar at CPM. I presented my work-in-progress paper on how rural roads change the nature of space in developing countries and can potentially lead to development in the area. 3 Oct 2017 Link to the presentation titled “How do you build a road to nowhere? History versus expectations framework”.1 09 Nov 2019 Email from Jim Meikle saying that he is leaving for Australia and would keep in touch over email. There was no email acknowledgement, feedback or discussion the note on either my Bihar road construction note that I had sent Dr Coffman and Jim or my presentation on 3 Oct 2017. Jim left for Australia on 9th Nov 2017 and was gone for the next 6 months. May 2017 While both Jim Meikle and D’Maris Coffman lost interest in the project, I went on to write an economic theory paper on the role of infrastructure in economic growth. The paper is called “Solow-Swan growth model and the fortunes of the commons”. Here is the link to the paper. 2019-2021 The work I did during 2017-2018 also became the basis of the course I created from scratch in 2019 titled “BCPM0008: Construction Industry Development”. Here are the links to the lecture slides, course outline, reading list for the course and my lectures notes for BCPM0008. The course had very high SEQs in academic years 2019-20 and 2020-21. 1.1.6 Controversy surrounding delivery of ENVS1006 There was utter confusion around teaching ENVS1006. ENVS1006 was the first year Economics course for undergraduates at CPM. The controversy largely erupted due to the different instructions Xuxin Mao and I were getting about the course ENVS1006 was supposed to be run. Dr Coffman had asked me to help improve the course. Dr. Aeli Roberts was asking Xuxin Mao to resist any changes to the course and setting him on collision path with me. Xuxin Mao was the module leader of ENVS1006 and had carefully planned the course over the summer. Then on 20 September 2017, for reasons that is difficult to comprehend, Dr Coffman asked me to get involved in the course and help improve it without clearly specifying who will do what. Course need to be planned well in advance and making changes to the course at this late stage is a recipe for disasters. The emails below describe the chaos the ensued. I have not even completed a month at CPM, so I was entirely unaware of how things ran. I was also under a great stress due to seemingly long list of errands Dr Coffman had handed me to do that seemed entirely unrelated to my job descriptions. Further, I was very concerned that there had been no paper trails of all the things I had been asked to do. I was still commuting 5 hours a day from Cambridge due to the inordinate delay in UCL giving me a contract that would enable me to rent a house. I also trying to house hunt at the same time. Some of the emails reflect this stress and frustation. The controversy lasted a week and it became clear to me that Xuxin Mao was simply being bullied and harassed by Dr Coffman and Dr Aeli Roberts after the email dated 11 October 2017 (10:34:35 BST) from Dr Coffman where she said No worries. I think my last email should remove any doubt about where this is coming from. He may be scared of me, but I think he’s more scared of Aeli.. It slowly dawned on my that what Dr Coffman had said was literally true and Xuxin was actually really scared. In retrospect, I am regret the week we spent argue but I am also reassured with the thought that I did my best to support him in teaching hence forth. This is reflected in the mutual warmth in the subsequent email. I also spent time help him improve his teaching technique and helping in any way that I could. The emails are more ominous in retrospect with the knowledge that within months Dr Coffman started preparing a case against Xuxin Mao to fire him. I was asked by Dr Coffman in my second probation meeting on 12 December 2017 if I had any evidence that would help her build a case to fire Xuxin Mao. She at that stage told me that she had learnt something from her Editor’s network that would help her build a case against Xuxin Mao. There was utter confusion around teaching ENVS1006. Different people were giving different directions to Xuxin Mao and me and the ambiguity in directions created a very difficult to working relationship between Xuxin Mao and me. Reading this after 4 years makes me extremely uncomfortable Xuxin Mao had been put in a impossible situation by Dr Coffman and Dr Aeli Roberts. I regret the part I unwittingly played in it. Within weeks of this conversation, Xuxin Mao and I realised that we had been given contradictory information by Dr. Aeli Roberts and Dr Coffman and our disagreement came from the differing objectives we had been given. We went one to become good friends and colleagues with mutually affection and admiration as the later email show. Xuxin was extremely diffident about delivering lectures in English. I had done a lot of training at LSE to improve my public speaking skills I had started teaching at LSE as a PhD student. I did my best to teach him techniques I had learnt at LSE. As I understand it, the key issue was that Xuxin had prepared the course as a “Construction Economics” course over the summer and had previously got instructions that he was going to deliver the whole course on his own from Dr Aeli Roberts, the Head of the Undergraduate programme. Conversely, Dr Coffman had instructed me to design and deliver a first year “Microeconomics” course. Unfortunately, Dr Coffman had not discussed this arrangement with Xuxin, the module leader for the course and was sending instructions to him through me. The whole issue arose because Dr Aeli Roberts was giving Xuxin Mao instructions that contradicted the instructions Dr Coffman was giving me. At this point, I had been working at UCL for about 3 weeks and had never met or spoken to Dr. Aeli Roberts. All instructions the seemed ad hoc and off the cuff and there was no formal process through which these decisions were made. As the Head of the Undergraduate programme, it was Dr Aeli Roberts who was responsible for ensuring that the course runs smoothly. Yet, she remained strangely silent through this whole debacle. Date Description 20 Sep 2017 I was informed verbally by Katerina Taka (CPM Teaching and Learning Team) that I was supposed to teach ENVS1006 with Xuxin Mao. Xuxin Mao was Lecturer at CPM and Module Leader for EVS1006. I meet Xuxin to discuss the course. Email from Xuxin after the meeting. Course plan from Xuxin where green indicated the portions Xuxin will teach and yellow indicates the portion he would like me to teach. 02 Oct 2017 Xuxin Mao delivers the introductory lecture EVS1006. 09 Oct 2017 Following Xuxin’s plan, I deliver my first lecture for EVS1006. Link to my lecture slides. The reading I set the students for my lecture. There was utter confusion around teaching ENVS1006. Different people were giving different directions to Xuxin Mao and me and the ambiguity in directions created a very difficult to working relationship between Xuxin Mao and me. As I understand it, the key issue was that Xuxin had prepared the course as a “Construction Economics” course over the summer and had previously got instructions that he was going to deliver the whole course on his own. Conversely, Dr Coffman had instructed me to design and deliver a basic “Microeconomics” course. Dr Coffman had not discussed this arrangement with Xuxin, the module leader for the course and was sending instructions to him through me. All instructions the seemed ad hoc and off the cuff and there was no formal process through which these decisions were made. 11 Oct 2017 My email exchange with Dr Coffman regarding teaching EVNS1006 with Xuxin. The email exchange started with Dr Coffman asking me to talk to Xuxin on her behalf about how the course would be delivered. Quote from Dr Coffman’s email to me where she is referring to Xuxin Mao: “No worries. I think my last email should remove any doubt about where this is coming from. He may be scared of me, but I think he’s more scared of Aeli.” This style management style seemed very odd to me. It seemed extremely inappropriate that intimidation was used as line management tool. It seemed even more inappropriate that Dr Coffman was discussing this inappropriate management style with me, someone she was line-managing at the time. 16 Oct 2017 Email discussion about my lecture before the lecture was delivered. Email from Xuxin Mao. Xuxin’s quote from the email. “I am concerned about how ENVS 1006 is being delivered. We should follow the syllabus more closely, which means microeconomics first and then macroeconomics.” My reply to Xuxin. The email expressing my concern about the Meyer’s book. Meyers, Danny (2012). “Construction Economics: A New Approach”. Routledge. This issue arose due to ambiguity of my role in teaching EVS1006. It was not clear whether I would do my own lectures or deliver the lectures Xuxin had already prepared for the course. I had a number of concerns about the material in Xuxin’s lecture drawn from Meyer’s book and had presumed that I would be allowed to draw from a range of sources including the pioneering undergraduate course material created by Prof. Wendy Carlin at Economics Department at UCL. Prof. Carlin’s has been keen to argue that the old distinction between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics was artificial and inhibits the learning process. Xuxin’s reply to me copying in Dr Coffman, Aeli Roberts and Katerina Taka. Dr Coffman’s reply to the group email. Xuxin’s reply to the group email Dr Coffman’s reply to the group email. 16 Oct 2017 I deliver my second lecture for EVS1006. Link to my lecture slides. Reading for the lecture. 16 Oct 2016 Following my lecture, there was an intense email discussion between Xuxin Mao, Dr Coffman and about my role in teaching ENVS1006. The discussion below suggests there was a problem in the way I was brought into the EVS1006 course without Xuxin Mao being consulted. It was not clear who took the decision and when. The ambiguous nature of the communication about task allocations meant that Xuxin and I were given different impressions about my role in the course. While I was given an impression that I would be designing my own course material, Xuxin was given an impression that I was to play the role of a teaching assistant. These kind of communication problems are hallmark of the ad hoc and informal management style employed at the CPM. My email to Xuxin expressing frustation at the fact that I have no say in what I was teaching. It also reflects my frustation that in stead of pursuing research related activities, I have been entangled in an on-going conflict between Dr Coffman and Xuxin. My frustation is reflected clearly in the following quote from my email to Xuxin. “I have 15 years to teaching experience but you refuse to entertain even a single suggestion from me. You have basically treated me like a teaching assistant. That is not going to work. I am a Research Fellow and teaching is not my job. I am happy to teach but trying to work out things with you is taking too much time and I can’t afford that.” Email from Dr Coffman to Xuxin Mao copying in Aeli Roberts and me. Reply from Xuxin. Xuxin’s quote from the email suggesting that the problem occurred because I was brought into the course at the last moment. “One thing has to be clarified is that the course was designed and submitted to handbook well before Dr Aniket jointed our school, with its contents already briefed to students. With more coordination and better communication, I firmly believe the misunderstandings happened for the past few weeks should be avoided.” Reply from Dr Coffman. Quote 1 from Dr Coffman’s email. “How can the course have been briefed to students before the start of term? Aniket joined on 4 September well before students arrived. You knew from the workload model you were teaching with him. You really should have taken on board his feedback.” As an aside, Dr Coffman is in incorrect in suggesting that I joined on 4 Sep 2017. My first day at CPM was 11 Sep 2017 and my first communication with Xuxin about ENVS1006 was on 20 Sep 2017. Further, it was never clear to me why I was being asked to teach a course that Xuxin had prepared over the summer and was more than happy to teach in its entirety. I have not been able to find the workload model Dr Coffman is referring to in the email. My understanding is that I was not in the workload model and I was inserted into the course at the last moment, after Xuxin had already designed and prepared the course material. Who took these decisions and why I was asked to teach ENVS1006 at the last moment have never been clear to me. Quote 2 from Dr Coffman’s email. “Beyond that, Aeli and I have concerns about the Myers textbook (that it’s too simplistic and not sound economics) and, in fact, Myers was not well-received when he gave a talk at CPM years ago. So I think this is probably a regrettable choice of text, and think you should talk to Gerard when he arrives in November about his own text.” This quote suggests that I was put in as someone to challenge the Xuxin’s teaching. In my opinion, it was entirely unfair to put me (a Research Fellow one month into the job) into a conflictual role with a lecturer. Xuxin and I went on to become really good friends and he asked me to teach him my lecturing techniques. I went often with him to lectures and by the end of the academic year had become a really good lecturer. Reply from Xuxin Reply from me Reply from Dr Coffman. Dr Coffman’s quote from the email. “Let me just add that I will be very annoyed with both of you if you can’t set the exams collaboratively. I don’t have the bandwidth at the moment to moderate disputes about content. This has to be about academic freedom and working collaboratively within that framework.” Dr Coffman’s email suggests that I am culpable in the on-going controversy regarding teaching ENVS1006. As far as I was aware, I have done everything by the book and followed the best practice of teaching the portion of the course I had been assigned. It was never made clear to me how I was culpable in this controversy even though Dr Coffman had in an earlier email expressed reservation about the course material and said that the Meyer’s book Xuxin was insisting on using is “too simplistic and not sound economics”. Reply from Xuxin Mao Reply from Dr Coffman Reply from Xuxin Mao My reply to the group email After this email, I recall an extremely good working relationship with Xuxin. The email exchange had also made me realise that the problem had arisen entirely because we had been given conflicting instructions to start with on 20 Sep 2017. 1.1.7 Book on Construction Economics Date Description 21 Oct 2017 Email from Dr Coffman asking me to write a textbook on Construction Economics. 1.1.8 Infrastructure and Affordable Housing research project with Stanimira Milcheva Date Description 01 Dec 2017 Getting involved in Stanimira Milcheva (Senior Lecturer, CPM) project on Infrastructure and affordable housing projects. My email to Stani after conducting a quick survey of the infrastructure literature and picking the relevant articles that we can use to proceed on the project. Stani’s reply 13 Dec 2017 Email from Stani asking me to help with the Infrastructure project. &gt; Quote from from email: “So, D’Maris is happy for you to help us – so I attach the proposal.” 14 Dec 2017 Stani’s email suggesting that we work towards producing a newsletter on infrastructure. 16 Jan 2018 Stani’s email suggesting a meeting for the infrastructure meeting. Confirmation of the meeting scheduled for 24 Jan 2018 with Aris Pantelias, Stani, Dr Coffman and me. 06 Feb 2018 My email to Stani and Aris on finding a topic for a workshop on infrastructure. Stani’s reply to my email. Aris’ reply discussing Dr Coffman’s involvement in the project. Email about scheduling a meeting on 16 Feb 2018. 23 Mar 2018 Email from Prof Coffman indicating that she did not like the direction of Stani’s infrastructure project. A follow up email from Prof Coffman reiterating the same point. 16 Apr 2018 Stani’s email to me about discussing writing a white paper on affordable housing. My email to Stani discussing the work I had done for the white paper thus far. Stani’s email to me indicating that she liked the direction the paper was heading towards. 18 Apr 2018 Probation meeting with Prof Coffman where she asked me to stop working on Stani’s infrastructure project. I was also very surprised to learn that the objectives of the probation were suddenly changing and that all the work that I had done towards the infrastructure project would not count towards my probation. 20 Apr 2018 My email to Stani explaining how my objectives of my probation have been changed suddenly by Prof Coffman. Stani’s reply to my email 1.2 Emails | Probation Timeline 1.2.1 3 November 2017 Coffman From: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Help Date: 3 November 2017 at 03:16:30 GMT To: &quot;Coffman, D&#39;Maris&quot; &lt;d.coffman@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Dear D’Maris, I am really really sorry to bother you with this but I could really do with some help. I am keen to crack on with work but there are number of issues making it difficult. After almost two months, neither do I have a laptop nor a functioning desktop. Michael has been doing his level best but due to some problem or other laptop has not materialised. The windows desktop on my desk is so old and slow that it is impossible to use it. Further, I keep getting kicked off my desk. Since yesterday afternoon, the IT guy has taken over my desk and kicked me off my desk. He is using my desk to repair someone else’s computer. And this is not the first time I had been kicked off my desk. I hesitated a lot before bringing this up but the problem is that I need to get cracking with work. I need to give Jim a draft before he leaves and also catch up with other work. Without a functioning computer and occasionally getting kicked off my desk makes things a bit difficult.

As for your desk, just tell the computer guy no. He has no right to do that, nor does anyone else.

I am keen to crack on with work but there are number of issues making it difficult. After almost two months, neither do I have a laptop nor a functioning desktop. Michael has been doing his level best but due to some problem or other laptop has not materialised. The windows desktop on my desk is so old and slow that it is impossible to use it. Further, I keep getting kicked off my desk. Since yesterday afternoon, the IT guy has taken over my desk and kicked me off my desk. He is using my desk to repair someone else’s computer. And this is not the first time I had been kicked off my desk. I hesitated a lot before bringing this up but the problem is that I need to get cracking with work. I need to give Jim a draft before he leaves and also catch up with other work. Without a functioning computer and occasionally getting kicked off my desk makes things a bit difficult.

Michelle can explain a bit more what your role could be but the idea is mostly that Lois feels integrated in the department and gets the right advice, i.e. conferences, how to engage with all of us, the academics and the PhD students, and more general topics. It will also enable you to have a supervisory track record and eventually be first supervisor. Let me know what you think.

This is a outstanding lecture note. I really appreciate your efforts that you have made. However, I am concerned about how ENVS 1006 is being delivered. We should follow the syllabus more closely, which means microeconomics first and then macroeconomics. And we definitely need to combine construction examples with economic principles, which means the construction economics text book needs to be used. If we do not follow it, it will give students conflicting information. I know it is too late to change the week 8 contents, but I do hope that we can catch up after your lecture so that we get consensus first before we delivering any more contents.

You have no idea how much time I have wasted in the last few weeks trying to work out how to reconcile modern Economics with Micro. You have also given me the wrong impression that you were going to design the course and I just had to follow it. This is not what D’Maris had in mind. I have had a chat with D’Maris and she made it clear that she wants me to design the course the way I think is appropriate. You may like to clear that up with D’Maris if you like. What I am teaching is Micro - the way it is taught in the best Economics departments in the world. Institutions, inequality, social contracts, firms and consumer choice are all interlinked. After all, how can you unlink consumer choice from institutions or firm choices from property rights? I have been teaching Micro, Macro, Development Economics, Political Economy, International Trade for more than 15 years now. So, I think I know what Micro is. What you are talking about is Samuelson Micro, which is no longer taught. I cannot in good conscientious teach something that is no longer considered correct. You are welcome to look the syllabus of Faculties around the world and if you find that I am wrong, I am happy to discuss it. If you are concerned, I am happy to defend my plan with a meeting with D’Maris. You are welcome to take over the whole course and teach it just the way you want to. But, if I am going to teach it, it is going to be the modern way.

Given the module contents have long been set in the undergraduate handbook and briefed to students during the introduction and first teaching week, if changes have to be made, we need to discuss them properly with the students and undergraduate course leader Dr Aeli Roberts and administrator Ms Katerina Taka. By the way, the book cost can be reimbursed via our department as I informed you before you purchased Meyers (2016) Construction Economics which I still think is a very good book with actual construction examples. As we discussed, we can adopt economic principles from the http://www.core-econ.org/ text book and construction examples from Meyers (2016), which I do not see why it is not unteachable. I hope you understand that I only want to deliver a good economics module together with you for students in construction project management not ones in an economics department. I am not against changes nor modern economics, but things have to be done following proper procedures. Given the week 8 contents were updated on Sunday, they should be delivered for the coming Monday lecture. We then should definitely arrange a meeting to put things forward smoothly based on necessary arrangements.

On what rationale? It’s very difficult to use the construction examples if the micro theory is wrong unless you just extract short readings on Moodle and don’t make them buy the book. I’ve only ever taught Macro to them but I really did intend for Aniket to teach micro and Xuxin to teach macro as they wish. It’s great if the content is coordinated, but if they disagree, it’s up to each individual lecturer. Yes, of course, the course needs to be tailored to construction management students, but intro micro also needs to be taught correctly. It’s a course taught everywhere, not just in economics departments but in politics, development studies, international relations, law, business, etc. No one teaches Samuelson any longer and it’s a real problem if they did because micro-founded macro needs a correct base. I’m reluctant to wade in on content but can someone show me a copy of this book since one of you is claiming it’s wrong. In the absence of that, i am concerned with academic freedom and Aniket is teaching micro and Xuxin macro.

Routledge can be pirates this way, and it’s particularly concerning because there is very little else called ‘Construction Economics’ out there. Most of what is available otherwise is for QS courses or at the BTEC level. Has anyone looked at Gerard de Valence’s book for the future? He’s a visiting prof with us and the intro to his text has a v good discussion of what CE is and isn’t.

You made the syllabus without consulting me without involving me. When I raised issues, you made no changes. I have 15 years to teaching experience but you refuse to entertain even a single suggestion from me. You have basically treated me like a teaching assistant. That is not going to work. I am a Research Fellow and teaching is not my job. I am happy to teach but trying to work out things with you is taking too much time and I can’t afford that. You seem to be stuck in your position and not ready to accommodate. I am happy to teach but only when I am given a say in the course. If you are going to tell me every week what I should be doing, then that is unacceptable to me. If you are ready to be professional in your conduct with me and respect my professional expertise, then I am happy to be friendly. But, I am sorry, if you are not going to give me a say in the course, then that is unacceptable to me. So, it is entirely up to you how our future relationship goes.

Because he’s already taught a couple Micro classes, you will need to first mark all the exams in the spring and he can second mark them to maintain parity of workload. Beyond that, you will need to coordinate with him on the draft exams, including the resit exam. For the avoidance of doubt, although you are the titular module leader, he is entitled to academic freedom to teach what he sees fit, and we have no right or ability to insist he teach to an existing syllabus in which he had little or no input. I understand that you imagined he would be agreeable to slotting into a course that you had designed (because it means less work for him), but you have to respect the fact that he’s not comfortable teaching the material you set. Beyond that, Aeli and I have concerns about the Myers textbook (that it’s too simplistic and not sound economics) and, in fact, Myers was not well-received when he gave a talk at CPM years ago. So I think this is probably a regrettable choice of text, and think you should talk to Gerard when he arrives in November about his own text. But in any case, we can re-think teaching provision for first-year undergrad next year given the pending replacement of Alex’s post with a lectureship.

I think it is good for me and Aniket to meet later this week so that we can inform you, Aeli, Katerina and students the final changes as soon as possible. One thing has to be clarified is that the course was designed and submitted to handbook well before Dr Aniket jointed our school, with its contents already briefed to students. With more coordination and better communication, I firmly believe the misunderstandings happened for the past few weeks should be avoided.

Aniket joined on 4 September well before students arrived. You knew from the workload model you were teaching with him. You really should have taken on board his feedback. I am not going to ask him to teach material that he thinks is not accurate or pitched at the right level, especially when Aeli and I have our own doubts about Myers. I was trying to reduce your fall workload and spare you two preps, but you’ve made that impossible now because Aniket does not want to teach a course that he thinks is badly designed and unsound analytically. That is his choice. The upside is hst you now get the spring to concentrate on your research. You didn’t run the course by anyone else on the econ and finance team from what I can see. That is your call, but UCL respects academic freedom and you must do so as well. Please take over Micro and let him redesign Macro as he sees fit. We can see at the end which was more effective at meeting students needs and interests.

I can appreciate why you are concerned giving the marks you got last year, but I don’t think you need to worry about students pulling out the course handbook and assessing the course against it. These are first year students after all. I think what you need to do is improve your classroom-based teaching through the UCL Arena process. Please book a time with Leo to come talk to me about this but do not use your submission to the handbook over the summer as a basis for dictating content to Aniket. Very many courses are co-taught and adjustments are made during the Teaching Resource Committees over the summer, and content changes as a result. We have no evidence, empirically or anecdotally, that students ever punish staff in their assessments on this divergence.

My apologies for being late on this. Alex’s paper was absolutely fine, so I did not have much to contribute. Xuxin’s paper require quite careful reading and rephrasing. I have sent him. detailed comments. It required a lot of reframing and that is why it got delayed. I had not expected that it will take a whole day and half.

I think we should meet sometime soon (how about Monday next week?) to catch up, especially since you will be contributing to IIF teaching. Kind regards, Aris From: Aniket, Kumar Sent: 29 September 2017 14:44 To: Economics and Finance Theme &lt;eandf@live.ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Digging the Dirt at Public Expense - paper by Engerman and Sokoloff I read a rather interesting infrastructure paper by Engerman and Sokoloff (2006) this week. The paper looks at planning and construction of the Erie Canal (1817-1825), the first big infrastructure project in the US. The paper finds that compared to the 11 other large infrastructure projects the US has implemented since, Erie Canal was well conceived and executed with a cost-overrun ratio of just 1.46. In contrast, the cost-overrun ratio of Mississippi River Levee Line (1883-1926) was 20, Interstate highways (1952-53) was more than 19.1 and Boston Central Artery/Tunnel (1991-2004) was 5.21. The really interesting bit in the paper is how this engendered growth subsequently in the US, which is related Krugman’s (1991) history versus expectations argument. The paper is also related to the literature on the localised historical shock (Davis and Weinstein, 2002, 2008; Miguel and Roland, 2011) and the literature on sub-contracting (Banerjee and Duflo, 2000; McMillan and Woodruff, 1999) and the local public good literature (Miguel, Gugerty, 2005; Ghani et al., 2016) Happy to chat further on this if anyone in interested in these areas or papers.

I am a new Research Associate in Economics at CPM and I have been trying to build a research project that 1) critically examines some of the assumptions in Economic models and 2) tries to incorporate experiential space in Economic models. The somewhat ambitious objective at this stage is to use game theory to understand how the constructed space intermediates human to human interaction and how social norms emerge as a result of this spatial interaction. A number of colleagues at CPM have suggested that my work is related to space syntax. Given how busy you remain, I have hesitated in approaching you until now and have finally picked up the courage to do so. If you ever have a moment to spare, I would really benefit from your guidance. A colleague and I have recently submitted a research proposal to ESRC’s Rebuilding Macroeconomics initiative where we set out how we want to embed endogenous space in an economic growth model. I have attached the proposal. It sets how where we are in terms of our ideas right now. Again, my apologies for taking up your time with this.

The literature turned out to be vast and took me a long time to get a sense of. My apologies that it has taken me so long to send you something on it. The short note desribes the model I have tried to solve. http://www.aniket.co.uk/research/Aniket_Desert.pdf There are still bits that need work, but I just wanted to see if you thought I was headed in the right direction. The note sets out a model based on Krugman 1980 where the number of varieties available is an endogenously determined. I have tried to model the role supermarkets play in the rural area by using a game called the Chain-store paradox. The model solves out to explain why pockets of depriviation emerge where people in deprived areas consume everything that is produced in other locations. There are a number of very interesting papers on “food deserts” in US and if I am not wrong, the model in the note may shed some light on why they emerge. The model is still very rough. So, my apologies if it does not read smoothly. If you have some time at some point, I could quickly talk you through the model. Thank you very much!

I wrote my email because of what I had been told by Helen Pascoe and D’Maris Coffman. It became clear to me from Prof Penn’s response that the objective of the meeting was to ensure that I don’t contact Prof Penn. It put me in a difficult position because Prof Penn had always expressed interest in my research ideas and strongly advised me to keep seeing him on the regular basis. Prof Coffman had warned me again and again not to see him. 11 December Meeting was warning sign to me of the extent to which Prof Coffman and Ms Helen Pascoe would go to me to ensure that I don’t contact him. 11 December 2018 I was forced to write apology emails to John Kelsey, Grant Mills and Helen Pascoe, even though it is still not clear to me what I had done wrong. I had argued for my student, who I felt were being discriminated against. I felt that allowed myself to get bullied by John Kelsey and let down my students in Disseration marking process in September. All I was trying to do is find a way so that John Kelsey would not fail the students again. I had a very strong feeling even then that they had not been failed for purely academic reasons. Four years later, my conviction that the marking process was not above board remains as strong as ever and CPM/BSSC has not learnt from the episode in 2018. 8 Dec 2018 at 10:06:19 Quote from Grant Mills’ email: “As I can see from your email to the student, you have accepted responsibility for: inadequate teaching, unfair marking and second marking, inadequate supervision and you have also told the student that they are “not the best” and you are unwilling to supervise them on legal and moral ground.” Grant Mills had asked me to sort out the crisis in 0052. It was a crisis that I had been trying to avert for weeks, but no one was ready to listen. Once the large contingent of students came to complain about John Kelsey on around 29 November 2018, suddenly I became the focus of everyone’s effort. Grant Mills characterisation of the situation is deeply unfair. There were obviously conversations going in the background and there was an effort divert the attention from the impending crisis in 0052. While I had made a mistake in copying in the student, I had accepted fully responsibility, the issue was not being seen as a honest mistake. In stead, the issue was being weaponised to make sure I keep quiet about the problems within BSSC. I am fairly certain that this is a case of stereotyping, i.e., where people of colour raise issues, it seen as both aggressive and challenging the entitlement of the privileged group. People of colour are tolerated if they are servile and submissive. If they show agency, then there is immediate need to sort them out and ensure that they know their place. I have tried my best to remain a force for good in spite all the opposition I have faced over the years at CPM/BSSC. I, along with my contributions, remain invisible. Conversely, there are constant efforts to oppose my effort to improve teaching standards at BSSC. 2.1 Disseration Marking 2.1.1 Li Chen’s Dissertation Supervision 2.1.1.1 Dissertation Supervision Allocation | 22 March 2018 From: &quot;West, Victoria&quot; &lt;v.west@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Dissertation Supervision Allocation - MSc Students Date: 22 March 2018 at 16:13:03 GMT To: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Dear Aniket The MSc Programme Leaders have reviewed the dissertation outlines submitted by our MSc students and feel you would be the best fit to supervisor the following student(s) for their dissertation.

You need to work a bit more on your Methodology (section 3) and Analysis and Result (Section 4). Basically, it not clear what is x. How is it calculated. Then its relationship with Boston Matrix and Bowman’s Strategic Clock is not clear. Basically, you need to be much clearer in explaining how you are getting x and then from that getting the z. Without that, it is not clear what this has to do with market potential. I also don’t understand what “status quo of infrastructural construction performance” means.

I have done some modification about my dissertation, especially in terms of your advice. The yellow highlight is the part I modified in terms of the questions in your last email. I hope I have explained clearly for such questions and it is easy for you to check that. Basically, the “infrastructural construction” is a typo. The infrastructure construction performance, as a variable that refers to the level of development of the infrastructure construction industry, will be explained by the scores that obtained from the calculations. The calculations part are emphasized in analysis section. As the basis for the classification of market types, the infrastructure construction performance of each country will be regarded as the variable x in the three-dimensional Boston Matrix; and the variable y and variable z refer to the infrastructure market space and level of risks, respectively. The infrastructure market potential of such countries is thus reflected by the classification result, shown by the Boston Matrix. As for the relationship with Boston Matrix and Bowman’s strategic model, I think there are not some special relationship between them. I use the Boston Matrix to do the classification of infrastructure market in terms of different market potential. And I just use the Bowman’s strategic model to do the classification of the entry modes. Thank you for your advice again! If there are more questions, please don’t hesitate to tell me.

I think we have a fundamental disagreement about this dissertation. However part of this may be to do not only with an understandable reluctance to fail a dissertation but also an understanding of where the pass/fail line is drawn. I attach my Blind Marking sheet. Basically my take on this is as flows:- The ‘research question(s)’ as such are far too broad, generic and ill-defined. Altman’s z-scores are irrelevant for examining either market potential or mode of entry (they might however be useful for certain types of investors and/or clients as part of their risk analysis). The BCG matrix is very old hat. It is now often omitted from the latest editions of marketing textbooks. A study in 1992 found that companies using it actually had lower returns than other similar companies. It is best applied anyway to consumer goods and services. Essentially infrastructure is not a business-to-consumer set of markets nor even a business-to-business set but rather business-to-government. Not only that but there is a great diversity of bundling, risk allocation and procurement modes. This makes it extremely difficult to judge profitability and market share (except possibly for tier 2 and below subcontractors and suppliers). Finally many infrastructure procurement deals involve what are essentially-built-in financial deals and it was agreed from the beginning that BCG analysis cannot sensibly be used where finance is involved because of the complexity of valuing financial products and companies. The quantitative method which appears to be used is that of multi-discriminant z-scores which is a statistical techniques completely separate from Altman’s model which is essentially a weighted linear multi-factor model (although the statistical justification for its use derives from the multi-discriminant model). One of the problems is then that all the references to Altman in the text are irrelevant in terms of justifying the use of this technique. The input data for the model apparently comes from a World Bank publication which is not in the Reference List. This is fatal. One of the things that is necessary is that any examiner ought in theory be able to re-perform the calculations shown in the dissertation. If this cannot be done then by definition the dissertation is basically unexaminable. However the problem is compounded here because the nature of the input data lacks any sort of basic clarity or explanation. Accordingly one can then see that the literature review is essentially irrelevant in addressing the research questions such as they are. One of the essential pass/fail questions is ‘does this dissertation make a reasonable even if poorly executed attempt to do what it says on the tin?’ In this case we have a number of tins with illegible writing and only a hammer with which to open them. I am sorry to be so brutally honest but there is no way I can put this before the external examiner Prof. Bernard Vogl and say that this is a UCL MSc dissertation of pass standard. Looking at the student’s scores for her taught modules it is clear that she does not have well-developed quantitative skills but has some quite good marks in her management modules. My recommendation is therefore that the re-submission should focus on some form of qualitative research.

So I am wondering in this second time, can I have a second professor to help me. It is my first time to fail a paper or work, I really feel worried and really desire to get my master degree and If I passed my dissertation in the second time, will I get my master degree delayed? I am wondering if I have to pay extra fee for the second submission. Thank you so much!! I look forward to your reply.

I am an Economist, with some very rudimentary knowledge of finance. I supervised Chen Li over the year. She is not be the best student, but met with her frequently and supervised her as best as I could. When I marked her dissertation, I didn’t think it was great, but I thought she should have passed with a below average mark. John insisted that Li, Chen and another student Xu, Tiantian should fail. He had a very specific idea about what methodology they should have used. That is when I realised John is teaching very specific methodology, which is entirely different from what I am trained in. I literally don’t understand even the basic of this methodology that is being taught. I also don’t understand why she failed. I have twenty years of teaching experience, so I am supremely confident that I know everything there is to know in Economics. Unfortunately, Finance is an entirely unrelated field that I know very little. Given this situation, I have no idea how to advise Li, Chen or Xu, Tiantian to change her dissertation and resubmit so that she can pass. In this, I would be entirely unethical of me and CPM to assign her to me, knowing fully well that both of them are going to fail. I take my responsibility to the students and CPM very seriously. In this case, since I am entirely incapable of giving her any useful advice, I would be doing something very unethical in continuing to supervise her. Further, I hope you understand that there is legal angle to this. If Li, Chen and Xu, Tiantian fail, then we at CPM would have failed to undertake our duty of care towards the students. So, there could be legal complications. So, I would urge you think about these two cases very carefully before you make a decision. I have emailed John and Ruhana about this. Ruhana has taken this up with Victoria. I want this to be taken seriously and I will push back on this because I think me supervising Li, Chen and Xu, Tiantian is unethical.

I understand your point. It happens with all of us that we supervise students who choose different methodologies and theories which we are not necessarily experts in the field. We seek additional support from colleagues, where necessary, who are experts in the field. We normally continue to be supervisor of the students who fail. I’ll consult with colleagues on this issue.

Let me state it more clearly. The point is this. The students are not being properly taught methodology in the course, which would help them write dissertations. Yet, they are being examined as if they were taught properly. What I am pointing out is that there is big big problem in the Economic and Finance dissertations that needs to be looked at very carefully. As it stands, it is arbitrary and unfair to students who were not previously trained in methodology. This is not about me needing help. This is about the dissertation programme needing help. I can also assure you that I have thought long and hard before bringing this up. This is not about me supervising a couple of students. It would take me no time to do that and I would happily do it if there was no issue at hand. This is about FAIRNESS to the students that UCL owes them.

Thank you for your email. I appreciate that you can let me know the story behind this. I am sorry for saying that you are lack of input before, as I didn’t know what was happening behind this. Honestly, I truly appreciate your help for my dissertation. And I totally understand what you have said in your email, including not continuing to supervise me. Now, I just feel disappointed and worried about my dissertation because it seems like it is hard for me to pass my dissertation and graduate from UCL. I truly desire to get my master degree and it is really important to me, indeed. So I will continue contacting Natalya and the cpm to ask for a feedback.

These are games where Pareto and Nash coincide. The paper does not even discuss equilibria.

See http://aniket.co.uk/b/0052w4/Lecture_52w4.pptx. Readings total 464 pages. See http://aniket.co.uk/b/0052w4/Reading_52w4.pdf. The lecture covers material that the Economics department at UCL is taking one full term to cover, that too with Economics students. Lecture slides full of mistakes and based on material not taught. E.g. slide 43, he has mistaken the wage curve as the labour supply curve. One of many catastrophic mistakes. The suggested topics for discussion are cryptic and enigmatic at best, with no indication for tutors as to what he expects. See http://aniket.co.uk/b/0052w4/Topics_52w4.docx. All the lecture required was 30-40 slides and about 60-100 pages of reading. Sorry for bothering you with this, but I needed to document the description of at least one lecture, because no one seems to believe me when I tell them what a disaster this course is.

We really appreciate your involvement. Because you know the depth of the subject areas, I can understand that it may feel like this is not creating an ideal environment for the students. At this point we just need to get to the end of the module and to deliver it professionally. The last session I imagine will have to be scaled done considerably / because much of the material has been covered, so this may be the last week where you come across the issue. We have in place a module SEQ, so we will get clear feedback on these problems. We may also need to do a post-mortem on some core modules and we would really appreciate your involvement in that.

Sure, happy to do a post-mortem once we are done. My tutorial seems to have gone off fine and students really seem to like it. I just got a semi-threatening email from D’Maris regarding the dissertation issue. I have serious concerns about the way John over-ruled Peter Hansford (second-marker) and me (first-maker) on the dissertation. Both Peter and I thought that the student should have passed but John insisted that they should fail. I think you are likely to get dragged into this if you have not already been. D’Maris claims I am making baseless accusations about John. All I want is what is best for my students, that is they should get a fair grade and not be penalised for something that is not their fault. Helen and D’Maris wanted my concerns in writing. I have written a short report of how things transpired with the relevant email in it. I am sending it to you as well. From my perspective, the email chain should raise concerns, especially the fact that John over-ruled both the first and second marker. In our meeting to reconcile the dissertation marks in October, John told me that I was not qualified to judge the dissertation and that is why he was over-ruling me. That is what I told Natalya. Now he claims that I am entirely qualified to supervise the dissertation. The problem is since I don’t understand what is in his mind and his lecture material does not help either, I have no idea how to supervise the students properly. I did contact him in November at the start of this saga, but he didn’t answer my email. But, I am very happy to be corrected if I am wrong on this. When you have the time, please do look at it. I am happy to find a fair and amicable solution, but I am extremely surprised D’Maris is playing hardball with me on this and trying to scare me to back down. When it comes to fairness, I will not backdown, even if lose my job over this. Please do feel like you have reply to this. But, please do look at the document when you have time.

The issue that we have is that in an email to the student you commented on a number of things, each of which we could receive a complaint about – all of them together could have significant ramifications. I have received at least 6 emails from the students one at 6 oclock this morning distraught about what to do. So I am trying to understand her concerns, which I hope will result in an effective submission of her dissertation with Stani as supervisor. I cannot second guess, but given your email to her the likelihood is that we will receive a formal complaint that will have to be escalated by Peter McLennan (faculty tutor) to the pro-vice Chancellor of teaching through a material irregularity. This will need to include your email to the student. As I can see from your email to the student, you have accepted responsibility for: inadequate teaching, unfair marking and second marking, inadequate supervision and you have also told the student that they are “not the best” and you are unwilling to supervise them on legal and moral ground. D’Maris wants to talk to you because she realises the significance of this on you, if this student makes a complaint. At this point, Stani is supervising the students and they are emailing me with issues and concerns.

I just hit the reply all button to include Ruhana, who was included in the original email. My mistake entirely! It is a grave mistake on my part and I am going to take full responsibility for it and am willingly bear the consequences for that. This is not an excuse for my grave mistake, but my email makes more sense if you read Natalya (15th Nov) and John’s (21st Nov) email to the student. I brought in the moral, legal and ethical angle in response to the arguments John and Natalya were making to the student. Hence, the subtext of my email was - let’s not make those arguments because it is not right. I am not sure if you have read those emails and emails afterwards provide all important context. Last, but not least, my apologies for adding to your workload. I hate making mistakes but when I do, I am transparent about my shortcomings, which I will be in this case.

I know it was a mistake, we all make them. At this point, we just have to be clear that we are all trying to rescue this situation ultimately for the good of the students - as you rightfully say we must give them all the support that they need. I think it will all be fine, but D’Maris and Helen need to see that you understand the implications and severity of the situation. Grant 2.4 Lead up to the Meeting on 11 December 2018 2.4.1 Dissertation issue | 30 November 2018 at 15:39:44 From: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Dissertation issue Date: 30 November 2018 at 15:39:44 GMT To: D&#39;Maris Coffman &lt;ddc22@cam.ac.uk&gt;, &quot;Pascoe, Helen&quot; &lt;h.pascoe@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Dear D’Maris, Helen said that you wanted to meet me about the dissertation issue. I have been tried to raise this issue in a collegiate way with a number of people in the last few weeks, but unfortunately, no one wants to take the time to listen to my concerns. As I told Helen, Grant, Aeli and Ruhana in meetings in the last week, I am taking a stand on this because is an ethical issue of fairness. I thought a timeline would help and may reduce the time you would need to take to get to the bottom of this. My apologies because it is long and requires me to explain the background of the current issue. --- Timeline --- Summer 2018: I was the first marker for Chen, Li and Xu, Tiantian. John was the second marker. As as first marker, I wanted to mark them in their 50s. John felt very strongly that they should fail. Given his experience and overview of the course, I was happy to embrace my ignorance and very respectfully agreed to follow his lead. My sense was that the disagreement was over the use of a specific research methodology. I thought given the research methodology they had been taught, they has written something adequate. John felt that they had not. John also told me that I don’t understand the specific Finance methodology and I was happy to follow his lead given his expertise. When it came time for Chen, Li and Xu, Tiantian to resubmit, I emailed John on 20th November suggesting that it would be in the students best interest if someone who understood the specific methodology would supervise the student. With my supervision, I was afraid that they would both fail. John never responded. In stead, I started getting emails from Natalya ordering me to supervise the student. I thought Natalaya or John would respond to my concerns, especially about the legal complication that would arise if the students failed again. It would be easy for students to argue that they did not receive proper supervision, given the mismatch between my expertise and what they are being examined on. Unfortunately, no one was ready to take my concerns seriously. I thought that there would be collegiate way out but all I got was orders. Frustrated, and at my wits end because time was slipping away fast, I raised my concerns with Helen last week, who in turn asked me to raise it with Grant. I raised the issue with Grant. I am glad that the issue has inevitably landed up with you, but I think it could have been easily resolved with a reasonable conversation. I would have taken some extra dissertation students in an area I can supervise and someone else with expertise would have taken on Chen, Li and Xu, Tiantian. --- End of Timeline --- As you may know that I doing 7 hours of teaching each week currently on three different courses, one of which I am creating from scratch. I have tried my best to create a cutting edge course that is a step beyond the core-econ. I am confident that I have created course that would create a new cohort of extremely engaged CPM students. Conversely, every week I have to read 400 pages for the other courses I am a tutor on, which are simple below below par. There are huge problems with the courses and I have tried my best to raise issues in a collegiate way and help in any way that I can - something hopefully Grant would attest to. The problem seems to be that the lecturers feel extremely challenged when I make suggestions. Given my 20 years of teaching experience, it is baffling to me that someone would forgo the opportunity to discuss the material with me. Result is we are delivering blatantly wrong material in lectures. Examples of the lecture material being blatantly wrong are: A lecture on moral hazard that describes a problem that has no moral hazard in it. The lecture was presenting a complete first-best contract where there is no moral hazard as a moral hazard problem. Or lecture on game theory where actually the lecturer has mistaken decision theory for game theory. Or a lecture where formulas on net present value calculation are wrong. If second year undergraduate in Economics would be failed if they made such mistakes in their examination. Given the gravity of the situation, when a student is failed, then there needs to be clear justification. We at CPM need to be clear that it is not a problem with the course material. I have done my best to raise concerns in a collegiate way for the last few weeks but John and Natalaya were not ready to listen. Hence, my stand on the dissertation issue is simply because I think I am being asked to something that challenges my ethics. Having said that, I would happily take on constructive criticism if you feel that I should have done things differently.

It is explanation for why I did what I did. Something, I did not want to put in an email that others were cced into. The way things transpired in October over Li, Chen and Xu, Tiantian’s marking left me with a distinct feeling that John had gone out of his way to fail both the student simply because I was supervising them. To exert his authority over me. I could be wrong, but the way he wrote the extremely long comments and the way he was insistent did not sound like objective marking. You may have seen in the emails that even Peter, the second marker for Li, Chen’s dissertation thought she should pass. I care deeply about my students and was racked with guilt at the possibility that Li, Chen and Xu, Tiantian were failed because of me. I thought the easiest thing would be to either get John or someone else to supervise so that my students pass. All I wanted was that my students get a fair deal and pass, which would never happen if I remained the supervisor. After all, we are talking of people’s lives and their future. The language that Natalaya and John have used in their emails to Li, Chen shows a degree of apathy towards students that makes me cringe. I am sure they have not shown you those emails. They are worth reading. My friends in Teaching and Learning group tell me that a group of people (not just Natalya) seized this issue as one they could weaponise against me. This is because I have been talking about changing this and improving the way we teach, which they find threatening. So, in stead of dealing with what was an urgent issue, Victoria spent ten days searching for regulation that would force me to supervise the students. As to why I took on Lois: Lois had trouble with Stani and so Michelle asked me to take her on as a favour. I would never say no to Michelle. Otherwise, I have no interest in taking on a Phd student, finance or otherwise. I have lost count of the petty humiliations that I have been subject to since I joined CPM. You have always fair and gracious to me. But, others have not been. But, I never thought I would be accused to trying to shirk responsibility. I have had fever for two days but that has not stopped me from delivering my 5 hours of teaching in two in days. So, the accusation that I am shirking responsibility is an amusing accusation.

This has got entirely out of hand. You have to remember that CPM is actually larger than Newnham in terms of total students and teaching provision and far larger in terms of student income. I’m not ignoring you but I am irritated this drama has landed on my desk. Grant is the equivalent of Senior Tutor both in terms of role and seniority and ordinarily would have been able to resolve it absent the escalating accusations you are making about colleagues. We don’t have the catering and hotel business, but we are a very large operation. You are making allegations about colleagues which we need to discuss, but it’s frustrating to me to know that you wanted someone else to supervise these students not because, as you originally told Natalya and John, you don’t feel qualified but because you felt John would not second mark fairly. You should have taken this to Grant or the chair of the postgrad exam board two months ago. I have TRC this morning but will create the time this afternoon as I go to China tomorrow. Kind regards D’Maris From: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Re: Confidential email Date: 5 December 2018 at 12:26:15 GMT To: &quot;Coffman, D&#39;Maris&quot; &lt;d.coffman@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Dear D’Maris, It was John who told me that I was not qualified to judge the dissertations and that is why he was over-ruling me. So, how can John think I am not qualified in October and but qualified in November. I told Natalya what John told me. I tried to talk with John asking him to help out. He didn’t answer. I tried Natalya, she took ten days to get back to me. I went to talk to Grant at length about this again and again. I spoke to Helen too. No one seems to want to react. This is incompetence on their part, not mine. If you mischaracterise my serious concerns and term it accusations, then I think you are taking a hostile attitude towards me and unnecessarily escalating the situation. It is up to, whether you want to amicable resolution or to escalate the situation. I am ready for both. I am pretty sick and tired with the way CPM has treated me anyway. Best wishes, Aniket From: &quot;Coffman, D&#39;Maris&quot; &lt;d.coffman@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Re: Confidential email Date: 5 December 2018 at 13:19:16 GMT To: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Dear Aniket I’m sorry we weren’t able to find a time to discuss this as it’s clearly causing you a lot of distress and is very concerning and frustrating for me at all, especially as you’re communicating very strongly that you have felt unhappy and badly treated at CPM, which I admit isn’t what I would have expected to hear from you. The last time we spoke about this in any detail, you seemed happy that CPM had helped you sort out the immigration issue via Ferguson Snell and seemed excited about research that you were doing on your own now that Jim is in Australia for six months and doesn’t need research support. I recognise that the autumn is a heavy teaching term, but I had thought things were going well now that you’ve passed your probation. That you obviously feel that this isn’t the case is something we do urgently need to discuss. As for the rest, I haven’t discussed this with John at all or with Natalya, beyond telling her that I secured agreement from another colleague (who is a finance academic) to supervise these two students for their re-submission. I’ve only discussed it with Grant insofar as he needs to contact the students themselves to provide them with pastoral care and reassurance that they will be given the assistance they need to resubmit. By reassigning the dissertations, I have sorted that out the operational issues. I think the rest will have to wait until next week. But I am not intentionally escalating this situation. I am just picking up on what you said below that you had the ‘distinct feeling that John had gone out of his way to fail both the student(s) simply because I was supervising’. That contains within it an accusation, as does the suggestion that your Teaching and Learning Group thinks that members of my team are trying to ‘weaponise this’ against you. You also told me that if I read their emails (which I have not had occasion to do) that I would see that John and Natalya have a bad attitude towards students. These are indeed accusations, which may or may not have merit, and they deserve careful consideration, as does the suggestion below that Grant and Helen have handled this incompetently. I don’t understand how I am escalating things by acknowledging that you have levelled these concerns, as they are serious enough to merit my involvement whereas otherwise a simple request to reassign dissertation supervision is something that Grant is empowered to handle himself. I am definitely not hostile towards you (and have known you for a long time), but I am really struggling to understand how this has got to this point. All that I can really say for sure is that it seems clear to me that you don’t have a particularly high opinion of the PML teaching, but PML started six weeks after the adjudication of the dissertation marks, which occurred in October. So that does seem to be a separate issue. Anyway, with the reassignment of these students to Stani, I think the urgency about meeting today has passed. I’ll look forward to seeing you on Tuesday when I return. But from my point of view, I am acknowledging that you’ve raised very serious concerns (if you prefer that term to ‘accusations’) and that we need to discuss these in person. You said yourself last week that you’re glad that I’m now involved. My aim is to de-escalate the situation, but I don’t see how I can do that without first acknowledging the seriousness of the issues you’ve raised.

The note contains a timeline followed with emails and other relevant document. In Li, Chen’s case I was the first-market and Peter Hansford was the second-marker. I hope it is clear evidence that both Peter Hansford and I wanted to pass Li, Chen but John overruled us. In Xu, Tiantian case, I was the first marker and Jonh the second marker. There is clear evidence in the email that I wanted to pass the dissertation but John overruled me. Please let me know if you need anything further on this.

I am really not sure how I missed the calendar invite. I absolutely feel awful. The argument that I was making has got extremely convoluted because no one is talking to me and taking my emails out of context. The arguments for Li, Chen and Xi, Tiantian’s dissertation is distinct from the reasons for Lois. It would be easier to explain in person. Having said that, I did not volunteer to take on Lois. I was asked to take it on and I was not sure if it was optional. If it was optional, I would not take her on. But, I am never sure what I am required to do and what I can say no to. Having said that, this does require a more detailed explanation. There is also an issue of the teaching workload. There are a lot of problems in teaching and I seem to be compensating for other’s people problem. Again, it is an argument I can make more clearly in person when I see you next week. Again, I am truly sorry for missing the meeting this morning.

Part of the reason is that I have been dumped with a lot of teaching and wanted to write something up before I wrote to you, but as I was struggling with the teaching load, and it ended up becoming a vicious cycle. The other reason is that I have been having a very difficult time at CPM at a personal level. I have challenged some unethical behaviour at CPM and as a result has been targeted. My situation at CPM is increasingly become untenable. The whole situation has been extremely stressful and I climbed into my shell as a defense mechanism. I also made some progress (but not enough) on three research ideas we talked about. Doing something on the spatial economy of UK. I have an idea of how to bridge the gap between urban and regional economics literature. Productivity: I have some preliminary results for a paper on the productivity puzzle. Turns out, aggregate level data is very misleading because it does not account for labour hoarding and firm exit and entry. Firm level data paint a different picture from the aggregate data. I have done some preliminary work on firm level data on construction sector and the results are promising. Poverty in India: I have looked at the urban and rural poverty data in India. There are some really interesting puzzles (I will let the attached pictures speak for themselves) in the data and I have some preliminary ideas about how to study it. I am currently teaching Monday 11-1PM, Tuesday 2-5PM and Wednesday 3-5PM and am absolutely flexible otherwise. I apologise for taking up your time on this but I would be very very grateful for your advice if you have the time. All I want to do is focus on bringing my research ideas to fruition and find a way out of the petty politics and unproductive distractions at CPM.

I have just been informed that when I met you last week, there was a ongoing GDPR issue that had been raised, which I was not aware of at the time. The GDPR issue was grave oversight/mistake on my part and I willingly accept whatever consequences there for me. I also feel very guilty for causing such a big problem for Bartlett. I should have known better. I am just writing to say that if I had known that there was a pending GDPR issue, given that you are the Dean, I would have waited for it to be resolved before I came to see you. My intention of coming to see you was solely to follow up on our conversation and seek some guidance about my research. And I was eager to do so before the end of term. My apologies for bothering you with this, but since this is weighing heavily on mind, I chose to write and explain myself. Hope that was not an inappropriate thing to do. Wishing you a very merry Christmas.

I had no intention of calling you incompetent. I was very very frustrated with the complication with the dissertation other teaching issues. You were extremely supportive. You took the time to listen to me and gave me excellent advice. Since I have joined CPM, you have been extremely supportive. I would not dream of calling you incompetent. That was a hastily written email with very clumsy wording, which deviates million miles from either what I intended to say or what I actually think of you. My fulsome unqualified apologies. These are not just words. I hope that from all my interaction with you, it is clear that I hold you in very high regard. I do hope you accept my unqualified apologies.

Words escape very fast from fingers on the keyboard, yet emotions on the face don’t lie. I do hope you have seen the respect with which I speak to every time I come to see in your office. I have always admired your calmness and objectivity, something that I can only aspire to. So, I do hope you will accept my unqualified apologies for my words in the email. I was very grateful that you pointed out I sounded resentful. As a reflective process, I have started making a list of things that have made me feel resentful at CPM. The list is turning out to be very very long and complicated and more institutional in nature than anything else. I also know that not everything on that list may be justified. I feel very misunderstood and almost like a pressure cooker right now. The pressure at work is so incredible. What I have been asked to deliver at work, I find impossible to do. I have not been able to sleep more than 4 hours for the last 5 weeks. That’s how bad things are for me. That’s why I have been constantly talking about my workload issue recently, but found very little traction. I also knew that given the nature of academia, it would be very difficult to raise the issue without stepping on someone’s toes. I am very grateful that you identified it this morning, because it will hopefully start the process of coming to grips with it. I also really welcome the opportunity to get a fresh start with a new line manager, who can assess my workload. I will reflect on it calmly over the break and at some opportune time next year, I would like to discuss some of the non-academic issues that complicated my life at CPM and would be very happy to take constructive criticism and feedback. I do hope that you accept my sincere unqualified apologies. And I am really sorry for adding to your workload. Hope you have a very Merry Christmas!

My comments are as follows:- 106611317 – agree mark 106756670 – I agree with your criticisms and for that reason would propose a mark of 48 (14+18+10+6) 106816803 – agree mark 106819910 – agree mark 106856675 – agree total mark but would redistribute as 60 (18+24+12+6). You have been quite complimentary about the Statement of problem and then only given it 17. 106867005 – agree mark 106908667 – I agree with your criticisms and for that reason would propose a mark of 46 (14+18+8+6) 106913936 – agree mark 106918854 – agree mark 106919816 – agree mark 106921633 – agree mark 106924936 – agree mark 106976360 – I agree with your criticisms and for that reason would propose a mark of 48 (15+18+10+5) 107083187 – agree mark I do have a concern about some of the wording of the feedback. Please do not use the word ‘dissertation’ when referring to the term paper. It is confusing to the students who we are trying to teach to use the right descriptions of different assignments. You have several assignments on which you write “The dissertation fails to motivate the problem properly”. I have no idea what this means – it certainly isn’t English. A number of the conclusions have the comment “The conclusions follow from the analysis and lack and insights”. Again I have no idea what this means – it certainly isn’t English. 106913936 – Conclusions - “The conclusions are well presented” but you have only given a mark of 11/20. The first eight and the final papers you write “The Presentation is Fine” - marks given 7, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7. The next four you write “The Presentation is average” - marks given 7, 6, 6, 5. This is precisely the sort of inconsistency on which students jump when criticising us. Can you please indicate if you agree the mark adjustments and whether you want me to adjust the comments.

The examination is written in latex. I use latex because it has a number of key advantages over word and other WYSIWYG software. Latex efficiently picks up the questions and answers from my question database, formats it and simultaneously creates examination question and the marking key. Since Latex produces pdf directly, reformatting it will require making changes to the latex files. The particular format I have used follows UCL examination guidelines fairly closely. If there is anything specific that needs reformatting, it would be easiest to let me know. Unless you would like to change the latex files yourself, in which case, I can see you the latex code and the question database.

On the Title Page, could you put it in this order please? BCPM0058 – Economics Class Test 1 and 2 Question Paper Duration: 1 hr 30 mins Can you delete the candidate number as the students will have a separate answer sheet? On the second sentence on the Title Page, could you put something like: This exam contains two tests: Class Test 1 and Class Test 2. You are advised to spend 45 minutes on each test. Sentence 5 – you have a split word – exam-ination – could you join it together please? Within the question paper, could we have the following please? Full stop or punctuation at the end of all sentences. If a question is a “finish the sentence” question, can you please put a colon Question 3 – could you join the word community on one line please? Answer sheet – Could you do a separate cover sheet for that page so I can print it separately please? BCPM0058 – Economics Class Test 1 and 2 Answer Sheet Duration: 1 hr 30 mins And some steps of how to completed. On the answer sheet, could you put the marks out of 20 after each section please? In the top right of both cover sheets, could you add the UCL logo please? We can chat tomorrow, if you are around.

As you would appreciate, I spent a fair amount of time last year consulting with the T&amp;L team, the second marker, Alex and Green Onions initiative before coming up with an exam format for the in-class test. I have briefly listed why the changes you have suggested are at variance with the advice I got from others last year. Going forward, I am very happy to stick to any best-practice list that T&amp;L team collates after requisite consultation so that everyone is on the same page. What is important is that everyone involved is consulted and are on the same page. Otherwise, we keep going in circles. We can’t put the duration as 1:30 minutes because there are two separate tests of 45 minutes each. It is very important to stress that. As things stand, these are separate tests. Given that students have to pass both tests, we have to make sure they don’t think of the test as one combined test of 1:30 minutes. Re: separate answer sheet Niamh Murtagh through the Green Onions initiative has laid great stress on reducing printing at CPM. This is why we put the answer sheet at the back of the paper last year. Niamh would argue that printing another cover sheet is unnecessary for an in-class test. Further, marking becomes more laborious both for me and the second marker if there is a cover sheet that we have to flip every time we mark an answer sheet. The second marker and I have spoken at length of about the format of the exam and answer sheet. We have agreed to a format that works best for both of us. It would be inconsiderate if I change the format without consulting her. My understanding is that in-class tests are relatively informal and most things are up to the discretion of the module leader and the second marker. It is my responsibility to ensure that I give clear instructions to the students and answer all the questions they have during the examination. My understanding is that this is different from the final examination where everything needs to be done extremely formally. Can you delete the candidate number as the students will have a separate answer sheet? There was a longstanding policy at CPM that examination papers always have candidate numbers so that students don’t try to cheat by exchanging examination paper. Punctuation. The punctuation in a multiple-choice question is a complicated issue and varies across the disciplines. Economics tends to follow the parsimonious approach and my second marker is happy with it. The role of the second marker is to pick up these kinds of issues. So, I am not sure where these concerns are coming from. If Alex has concerns, then I am happy to have a chat with him and explain the second marker and my views on this. If you want to change things, it would be easiest to draw up a list of best practice after consultations and circulate it. Otherwise, it is very difficult for me to reconcile what different parts of CPM want from me. As I am sure you would appreciate, this in-class test is a very small part of my complicated teaching week where I am teaching across 4 different courses and keeping up with my research. I don’t want to go back to re-editing the in-class test unless there is something critical or urgent that contravenes UCL regulation. I will mark the exams on Friday afternoon and send you the marks on an excel sheet once I have agreed on the marks with the second marker. Could you please send me your preferred mock of the excel sheet so that we can get it done in one go.

I completely understand your workload and adapting layout, punctuation etc isn’t at top of the list, however, that why I ask for it a week in advance so I would do the changes and take that workload from yourself. However as it is completed on a different programme, it difficult to adapt it myself. With regards to punctuation, the whole idea is to ensure continuity between all papers and all questions so I was just highlighting areas of importance to ensure all questions end the same. In Economics 2 paper (attached) - nothing ends in a full stop, for example. With regards to the separate answer paper - wouldn’t it be easier to have that separate from the question paper to stop flicking between multiple pages for the student? Attached is the example of what I have done and will only use one piece of paper. I spoke to Alex and Shen yesterday regarding the timings of your tests. If you are doing them back-to-back, you want the students to stop and wait until the next ones start? Because they are all attached, the students can view the questions at any time. Alex and Shen suggested that they continue through both tests during the time, rather than stopping and waiting. There isn’t currently a best practices document for examination papers, however as a result of this examination process, I will be creating one. We also discussed the digital accessibility process. The last thing we want is to overburden you anymore. As I said, I am more than happy to talk to you and discuss this further. Are you available tomorrow sometime?

Regarding my teaching allocations, the Workplace Health referral documentation says that “this has been reviewed and the teaching allocations are within the normal boundaries for the role.” I was not aware that this review process has already taken place. Stani also has not mentioned that the review was already complete. I would be grateful if you could send me some details so that I can have a better understanding of the review process. It would really help to have my job descriptions, the teaching load that is considered normal or consistent with my job descriptions and my current teaching load for 2019-20 as recorded by the CPM currently. As you may appreciate, this is likely to come up during my conversation with the Workplace Health advisor and since I don’t have this information at hand, it would be difficult to have a conversation without this information.

I have notes from a meeting with you in December 2018 where we discussed your workload, and D’Maris explained that we usually expect our Research Fellows to undertake 4-6 hours teaching for us as part of their contracts (I double checked this with HR who have confirmed that an average of 6 hours over the year is a normal expectation in the Research Fellow contracts, and this can be bunched together to fulfil teaching needs – this equates to 270 hours per year in total). Because your workload is the same as last year, we haven’t a further review of this though. We wouldn’t normally expect that workload is addressed via the appraisal system (which is designed to set targets for the year ahead and to help colleagues in their development, however, as you raised health issues with Stani at your appraisal, which we weren’t previously aware of, it is absolutely right that we seek to support you with these. The mechanism we have for these is via the workplace health team – they will want to know that the teaching workload is within the normal remit of the role – which it is as previously discussed – but they can of course make recommendations around this if they feel that is appropriate once they have discussed your health needs with you. I hope that helps – can I suggest that we meet (perhaps with Stani and D’Maris too) once you have met with the Workplace Health team and we can review their recommendations?

Now that we have the occupational health report back today, I want to follow-up with you about the concerns that you raised in your annual review and that are voiced in the OH report. We understand that you feel your teaching load is causing you considerable stress and is interfering with your research productivity. We have discussed this with our HR business partners who are very firm that your teaching load is about two-thirds of the maximum that we can expect from core-funded research fellows (i.e. well within your contract), that it builds on your existing strengths (you have been teaching micro and macro for decades and have a PhD in development economics), and is suited to your role. We have been reassured that our policies and procedures on RF workloads are line with UCL HR policy. You cite your teaching load as the reason why you have not been able to produce any published research outputs in the last three years, but UCL HR does not believe that to be a credible explanation in itself. The OH report therefore suggests that we establish weekly or fortnightly line management meetings with you to understand why your teaching workload, which should not objectively be causing problems, is causing you such stress. Moreover, we need fortnightly line management meetings to understand why you’ve been unable to produce any research outputs as the growth model paper was submitted to SCED back in 2018 in the first instance and was rejected after review. I would have expected that least to be out by now. I understand you make comparisons between your workload and the other two core-funded research fellows, one of whom was on an internal sabbatical this past year given her long-standing significant enabling contributions, and the other of whom works closely with an established member of staff to continue a research centre established by a deceased one. You do not have sight of their overall workloads, but I can reassure you that your workload is among the lightest in CPM, precisely because we’ve been trying to support you in developing your research career. Given the need for weekly or fortnightly line management meetings and to ensure that your research and teaching workloads are considered together, Helen and I have decided that Judy should replace Stani as your line manager as she is in the best position to address these issues. From what I gather from your meeting with Stani yesterday and my own conversations with her, she does not understand why research productivity has been such an issue for you. I am confident that you and Judy can get to the bottom of this in line with the recommendations of the occupational health report. If you have any questions or concerns, I am happy to meet with you, Helen and Judy.

I will have the statement and supporting documents ready by the start of next week and will submit them as soon as I have had an opportunity to speak to Gemma. My apologies for taking up your and Gemma’s time in this difficult period. I do hope that once I have submitted the statement and evidence, a swift resolution can be found.

I was able to conduct an initial telephone assessment with Dr Aniket on Wednesday 09 September 2020 to discuss the issues outlined in your referral letter. Dr Aniket has given verbal consent allowing me to generate this report. BACKGROUND As you are aware, Dr Aniket is employed full time as a Research Fellow. I note the reason for this referral is due to some health and work concerns. Dr Aniket reported some work related concerns that he states were highlighted eighteen months ago. I am also aware that there has been no sickness absence. He also reported an underlying medical condition. CURRENT POSITION &amp; MEDICAL ASPECTS Following my assessment, there are some perceived work related concerns pertaining to demands and his role within the workplace. As you might be aware, The Health and Safety Executive identifies six key factors of work design that if not managed effectively are known to trigger work related stress or exacerbate symptoms of a pre-existing condition. These factors are demands, control, support, relationships, role and how changes are implemented within an organisation. My findings are that Dr Aniket’s underlying medical health condition coupled with his work concerns have a functional impact on him in the following ways: Difficulties concentrating Anxiety symptoms Dr Aniket is aware of the support that is available through his General Practitioner (GP). In addition, I have also highlighted support through UCL resources. FITNESS TO WORK In my opinion, Dr Aniket is fit for work with some adjustments in order to minimise the risk of any work-related issues exacerbating his current symptoms. I would advise that you consider adjustments to remove the disadvantage that his current symptoms might be causing. Adjustments you may wish to consider include: A stress risk assessment as there are some perceived work related concerns in the workplace. UCL has a duty of care towards its staff and a legal obligation to provide a safe working environment. In my opinion, this assessment gives both the manager and the employee an opportunity to explore any negative work related stressors and to explore possible ways of addressing and resolving them, if appropriate. Information about the risk assessment can be found by following the link below: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/managing-stress-work-appendix-2 Click on appendix 2 and the ‘check list’ for the template. However, additional guidance can also be accessed from the Health and Safety Executive site: http://www.hse.gov.uk/stress/standards / or manager’s toolkit: http://www.hse.gov.uk/stress/assets/docs/stress-talking-toolkit.pdf Management support in the form of regular one to one meetings with Dr Aniket every week or fortnightly in order for him to highlight any concerns and for you to monitor his progress effectively. I have highlighted additional support through UCL’s Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), Care First which is available for staff 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year. T: 0800 197 4510 or log on to the OHW EAP page: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hr/occ_health/eap.php or Care first leaflet I have also highlighted the importance of maintaining his overall health and wellbeing. However, additional guidance can be accessed from Care First Zest by logging on as follows: URL:www.ucl-zest.co.uk Organisation Code: UCL1 Dr Aniket could also benefit from some additional self-help resources from Wellbeing @UCL, Mind and SilverCloud (online cognitive behavioural therapy) in order to help improve his overall health and mental wellbeing in the workplace through the following hyperlinks: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/health-wellbeing/wellbeing-ucl https://wellbeingucl.silvercloudhealth.com/signup/ How to improve and maintain your mental wellbeing How to manage stress Dr Aniket could also benefit from some support through the new NHS and Public Health initiative on their Every Mind Matters campaign through the following link: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/ A further COVID 19 risk assessment is also advised and maintaining a COVID Secure working environment whilst adhering to UCL’s and government guidance as stipulated in the following links: https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/covid-secure.htm https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus https://www.ucl.ac.uk/coronavirus/keeping-safe-campus As the manager of this employee you will need to consider if the adjustments are reasonable, feasible and appropriate. PROGNOSIS Dr Aniket’s symptoms are unlikely to improve completely whilst the issues in the workplace remain unchanged. However, with the appropriate management support and team support he should be able to manage reasonably well in the workplace. In addition, a suitable stress risk assessment and regular reviews would minimise the risk of any work related issues exacerbating his symptoms. I have not arranged any further follow up appointments. However, if you have any further questions or require additional advice please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss.

We discussed options for resolution of this issue and you indicated that you would like to pursue informal resolution in the first instance. If that doesn’t work then you can follow UCL’s formal grievance policy. We agreed that I would approach Christoph and ask if he would consider meeting you, ideally with your mentor (Stefano Miraglia?) to discuss your experiences in confidence. We will come back to you about this within the next couple of weeks. You can come back to me to discuss this issue, or anything else that happens, at any time. As a reminder, UCL’s Employee Assistance Programme (details here) can provide practical information and advice about stress as well as counselling and emotional support. They can be contacted on 0800 197 4510, available 24 hrs a day. Our stress management policy can be found here.

I can confirm that I would like to pursue the informal resolution in the first instance and would welcome an opportunity to speak to Prof Christoph Linder. I would like to have my mentor Stefano Miraglia present for the conversation if that is possible. On reflection, I felt that I was quite descriptive in our conversation today. In my narration, I fear I may not have been vocalised my complaint against Prof D’Maris Coffman and Ms Helen Pascoe precisely. My complaint can be briefly summarised in the following words. “My complaint is that Prof D’Maris Coffman and Ms Helen Pascoe have consistently exhibited signs of implicit bias towards me in their interaction with me through the last three years. Due to the implicit bias, they have been quick to jump to the conclusion that I am at fault even when evidence pointed in another direction. They have never given me the benefit of the doubt. Their actions have belittled and humiliated me on various occasions. I have consistently been treated worse than my peers. While each incident can be seen as an aberration, when examined collectively, there is a discernable pattern of systematic discrimination.” Could I please enquire about a couple of things that I have not been able to ascertain on my own. I was hoping that you could also guide me towards the UCL policy that prescribes the teaching that Research Fellows could be asked to do. You mentioned 6 hours, but it is not clear to me how that translates to an academic workload model, i.e, what is the conversion rate that applies for marking, preparation, dissertation supervision and other admin duties to the hours per week measure. I would be grateful if you could guide me to exact policy document or the legal opinion on which the 6 hour policy is based so that I could read through the details myself. I have asked Ms Helen Pascoe for my job description on file but I am yet to receive an answer. According to my notes, I had applied for Job Ref 1645766. The job was advertised on 22 May 2017 and closed on 27 June 2017. Could I please confirm that my job description is in line with the job I had applied for, i.e., Job Ref 1645766. Thank you very much for your help and my apologies for bothering you with these queries. I hope the conversation with Prof Linder materialises and the situation can be quickly resolved.

I have been on annual leave. Christoph has agreed to meet with you and Stefano and his EA will contact you to arrange it. UCLs policy on Workload planning can be found here: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/workload-allocation-framework-academic-staff. There is no UCL written policy of a maximum of 6 hours Teaching for Research staff, but its history stems from UKRI guidance found here https://www.ukri.org/files/funding/ukri-fec-grant-terms-and-conditions-guidance-pdf/ The relevant paragraph is RG08. Although not all research staff are covered by these terms (including yourself) for parity we recommend the same maximum. You will see that the 6 hours includes all relevant admin, preparation and marking etc… The JD on your file is attached.

Stephenson Lecturer in Economics and Finance of the Built Environment, Director of Teaching and Learning and Departmental Tutor, Bartlett School of Construction &amp; Project Management, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place London WC1E 6BT. 3.3.1.1 1 October 2020 From: &quot;Stephenson, Judy&quot; &lt;j.stephenson@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: 2nd meeting Date: 1 October 2020 at 12:00:46 BST To: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Dear Aniket, As HR /OH have told us to have a meeting every two weeks apparently I should also take notes. Can you let me know whether you think these notes are accurate? Please change anything you think is not. It will not be recorded until you are ok with it. You’ve moved house and the new place is great and free from pollution which was affecting you and your stress so this is great news. Congratulations it looks lovely! You will update occupational health on the episode of mental health during the summer which wasn’t reflected in the original report. You’re going to register with a GP as well and keep occupational health abreast of any other issues that they or your GP feel need to be included. You have booked an appointment to see Christoph next week because you have decided that you do have grounds for grievance that you want to explore and possibly take forward. You have not finally decided whether you will go forward on the grievance or not. The grievance relates - very broadly - to two things. Firstly, you feel your job description changed since you joined CPM. Between what you felt was too much teaching for a research fellow and other issues you were effectively not able to develop the research work that you wanted to or could have. Secondly, the other issues are that you believe that D’Maris, as head of department and Helen as school manager have been biased against you. You pointed out that the HR guidelines on six hours teaching for RF’s including prep and admin was not what they have said to you in the past. You have documented other issues and specific incidences which you have not discussed with me which demonstrate this bias against you. You also feel there are diversity issues and prejudice and bias at CPM. I haven’t pressed you to tell me specific incidences of what you think they are. You haven’t quite decided how you will progress the grievance procedure but you see the material that you have at the moment as a threat and you want to make it understood. What you really want to do is good research and you feel that’s your job and you feel that you will be able to pursue this if you feel that the grievance is heard. You believe there may be opportunities to do the sort of research you would like to effect in other parts of the Bartlett. You are happy to continue teaching now, as you are also fit to, but you asked me what would happen if you refused to teach the tutorials on 0002. I have said I will find out. I have also said that I will continue to explore whether we could replace you on 0002 now this term as it’s obviously a very bad fit for you and causing some stress, and in response the the OH stress assessment this summer it would be - if we can- beneficial to take you off this short term and find something better fit long term. I have heard very clearly that you don’t feel that teaching tutorials is a good use of your time. You made it clear that you do not see the meeting with Christoph as business as usual and you are hoping for the result of that meeting to be some kind of change or decision about how you will pursue research. You have developed a research plan - around brickmaking and social and environmental costs in Bangladesh which you plan to apply for funding for with external colleagues. We agreed to meet in two weeks time and aside from the action summarised in this note no other actions can be taken until you’ve had the conversation with Christoph that you want. Let me know if there is anything else you want to include, Best wishes, From: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Re: 2nd meeting Date: 5 October 2020 at 23:02:05 BST To: &quot;Stephenson, Judy&quot; &lt;j.stephenson@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Dear Judy, My apologies for delay in replying to this. The notes are absolutely fine and reflect our conversation accurately. Could please suggest two changes. Please do let me know if you think these changes are fine. Point 7: I would ideally like to remove the phrase “but you see the material that you have at the moment as a threat and you want to make it understood.”. I am just exploring my options at this stage and I may have mispoken if I used the word “threat” in our conversation. What I meant was more like I would like to keep my cards close to my chest for now. We had discussed the fact that I don’t understand how my workload has been calculated for the last three years. I was wondering if we could just a line about it with any wording that you think is appropriate. Please do let me know if you think these changes are fine. With best wishes, Aniket From: &quot;Stephenson, Judy&quot; &lt;j.stephenson@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Re: 2nd meeting Date: 6 October 2020 at 06:07:51 BST To: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Hi Aniket, morning !! Totally fine - I will amend point 7 to delete the last half as you request. If I add to point 9, saying “ You don’t understand how your workload has been calculated in the last 3 years” would that put it in context ? If this is okay with you then I will send you another email with the rewritten points as a record of the meeting. When are you seeing Christoph by the way?

Thank you very much! The meeting with Christoph is on Friday at 12PM. Fingers crossed!!! I have just finished the Tutorial group today. It is actually a lot of fun. A very interesting and engaged group that was even more engaged than last year’s group. There is one thing that I said I will check with you and get back to them. Group 1 were very keen to know about the presentation topic next week. I am not I recall what you had said about how the presentation topic will be communicated to them. Is the question already on the Moodle. Just let me know what I should tell them. Best wishes, Aniket 3.3.1.2 5 October 2020 From: &quot;Stephenson, Judy&quot; &lt;j.stephenson@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: 0002 Date: 5 October 2020 at 14:21:06 BST To: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Hi Aniket I have clarified the situation on 0002. I am still exploring trying to get you off 0002 this term in response to your recent stress as a short term thing. Not easy given conditions. So I have no short term solution. Since OH have not said you should not teach it it has to be done in an informal way and I literally have no one else at present. I had to speak with Gemma in HR to find out process on this if you decide to refuse to teach it. Since it is - according to Gemma, a reasonable task, if you refuse to do so it will trigger performance management / or a disciplinary procedure. Let me know if you want to talk. I know 0002 kicks off tomorrow.

I am really sorry you have to spend time doing this when I am sure you have so much on your plate. I am basically waiting to see what Christoph says on Friday. I will think of what I will do once I have spoken to him. I doubt I will stop teaching. It is just something I would never be able to do. I might go to Union if nothing comes out of the meeting with Christoph. I am really grateful for time you have spent on this. At the risk of sounding over-dramatic, can I just say that I have not experienced the kindness you shown me from anyone else at CPM since I have joined. I am overwhelmed that someone in CPM actually cares. So, a big thank you for that.

Please don’t worry about finding someone for 0002. I had actually not realised that it would be so difficult to find someone for 0002.

The length of the email reflects both the difficult situation I find myself in and the list of issues that have taken a toll on my mental health. The straw that broke the camel’s metaphorical back is a set of puzzling directives I have received about the new procedure for resits and deferrals for 0058. As an educator devoted to the students, I am always eager to implement any suggestion that would help the students. In this case, unfortunately, I fear that these new directives misread the problem of the 0058 resit/deferral students at best and are misdirecting scarce resources away from the real problem at worst. The reason why 0058 has been so popular with the cohorts in the past is because of my approach of diagnostic pedagogic. It is an approach that follows the Heckman-Cunha model of cognitive development as (laid out in their seminal paper Cunha Heckman (2007), reference below) and the work on diversity and cognition by Richard Nessbitt. The key to this approach is understanding the role dynamic complementarities play in the cognitive development process and then using it to diagnose and identify the individual specific stumbling block. While the previous leaders of the undergraduate programme were keen to both allow and learn from the intellectual diversity within the undergraduate programme, it is unfortunate that the current leader Selcuk Cidik has chosen not to build on his predecessor’s successes. Instead, his approach has been to re-invent everything. While gradual consultative change has the potential to be useful, radical change has the potential of being extremely disruptive. It has been a dystopian academic year where a bewildering range of “top-down” bureaucratic changes have left the module leaders confused. And when the module leaders are confused, they can’t do what they do best - teach. I have never seen such dissatisfaction in the undergraduate programme, both on part of the students and module leaders, as I have seen this year. I have also been particularly stuck by Selcuk’s tendency to take credit for everything positive and blame someone else (usually the module leader) for all the problems. It is difficult to overstate the corrosive effect the culture of blame has had on the undergraduate programme. Specifically, in terms of 0058, Selcuk has taken an approach where he has tried to micro-manage every single tiny aspect of the 0058 course leaving no latitude for me as a module leader to take any decisions based on my assessment. (On one extreme instance, he attempted to interfere in the marking process and sent me an email contradicting my feedback on term papers and adding his comments.) It has been a year of radically ill-advised experimentation through diktats and directives without any consultation. This is in stark contrast to the approach followed by his two predecessors, Alex Opuku and Aeli Roberts. Unfortunately, when Selcuk’s experiments went wrong, as they have in 0058, and students complained, Selcuk has failed to take responsibility. Instead, his approach has been to blame the module leader for everything. For every tiny issue, I have had to fight tooth and nail to be allowed to do what I think is in the best interest of the students. On every tiny issue, my judgement has been questioned by Selcuk. The time, energy and mental resources it takes to fight Selcuk’s diktats and directive is enormous and has taken a toll on my mental health. What has compounded the problem is that Andy has failed to provide adequate administration for the course. I have detailed the long list of Andy’s missteps in an email dated 22nd March 2021 to the Teaching and Learning manager. I have always been grateful for your support in this matter. Out of consideration for your time, I have hesitated in the past to bring every single matter to your attention. Needless to say, the list of issues is long. 0058 was a beautifully run course before Selcuk came and decided to re-invent everything. This brings me to the current set of directives. The students in 0058 have received extensive individualised feedback both on their formal and informal submissions. I have diagnosed and provided students with individualised verbal and written feedback and as a result, I can confidently say that I have actualised each student’s potential to the fullest extent possible. Even a cursory look at the Term Papers would reflect the cognitive development 0058 has been able to facilitate. The case of Rhayna Rijanto illustrates the point. She was extremely vocal about the problems in the course because of Selcuk’s experimentation at the start of the year. It was hard work for me to gain the trust of the students including that of Rhayna after the initial problems. Rhayna scored 56 on the first term paper and was extremely disappointed with her mark. Rhayna spoke to me at length during term two about the course. I was able to diagnose the key problem she was facing. Rhayna scored 75 in her second term paper. She wrote a fascinating thought-provoking paper that is worth reading. This shows you what a course like 0058 can do for the students. There are numerous other examples like Rhayna of students who I have tried my level best to help in any way that I can. Several students have been in touch with me to ask me for further reading material so that they can continue the intellectual journey they started in 0058. Unfortunately, the metric CPM/BSSC uses to evaluate courses does not take the cognitive development of the students into account. I remain mystified how the achievements of 0058 remain such a well-kept secret within the programme. There is not a single student who is resitting due to a lack of individualised advice. The only students resitting are the ones that had followed poor academic practice. I was supposed to be initially involved in informing students of their poor academic practice and give them advice on how to improve. I am not sure what happened because I was not kept in the loop. So, I don’t know how things stand as far as the cases of poor academic case conduct in 0058 are concerned. As I understand from the limited information I have been given, these are the students who are resitting. Each student usually has a different set of problems and I am convinced that the one “size fits all” “top-down” bureaucratic approach of issuing directives without consultation with module leaders is detrimental to the student’s interest. It leaves module leaders confused and dazed. This stands in stark contrast with the more genial collegiate approach in the undergraduate programme in previous years. The second problem with Selcuk’s directive is its implication on my workload. Since 2018, when the method of assessing the workload at CPM/BSSC was changed from a quantitative one to a qualitative one, I have on numerous instances made the following two points to my previous line-managers. My workload does not reflect the actual time it takes to do the work allocated to me. There is a key distinction between ex-ante workload and ex-post workload. While the ex-ante workload may have been calculated based on some assumptions, the reality could always deviate from those initial assumptions. Best practice should ensure that both ex-ante workload and ex-post workload is calculated. As I had pointed out on numerous occasions to my previous line managers, there is a vast difference between my ex-ante workload and ex-post workload in my time at UCL. Selcuk, in pursuit of his various experiments, has issued several uncompromising diktats asking me to make significant changes to the 0058 course. These diktats have increased my workload by a significant amount. What concerns me is that he bypasses the line-management system and issues diktats directly to me. This naturally implies that the ex-post workload is far greater than the ex-ante workload calculation at the start of the academic year. It needs to be appreciated that the new directives on resit/deferrals are extremely arduous when applied to 0058. I had made plans to work with my research collaborators in July and early August. I am sure you would appreciate how difficult it is to work in an unpredictable environment where all plans can be undone by diktats. This unpredictable environment of sudden “demand” and “control” are related to factors that trigger stress and was noted in my workplace health report dated 9 September 2021. It has been a very difficult year, where I have continued to deal with the mental health issues arising from the culture at CPM/BSSC. I have given everything in order to ensure that 0058 and 0008 have been run as exemplary courses. Unfortunately, the bureaucracy associated with the course has proved to be extremely time-consuming, unpredictable, overwhelming and mentally exhausting. After I had done everything asked of me, I had hoped to get a clear stretch when I could focus on my research, which should be the primary focus of my job as a Research Fellow. Instead, I have been handed down another arduous task bypassing the line management system with no reassurance that an ex-post workload would ever be calculated for the academic year 2020-21. What the students resitting 0058 need is advice about good academic practice. Since I have been kept out of the loop on what happened earlier in the year regarding cases of poor academic practice, it puts me in an awkward position of not knowing exactly how things are in my own course. On my part, I have already offered to provide individualised attention to students who are resitting. At least one student called Shuyu Liu has already got in touch. My second concern is about tasks that lead to promotion and tasks that do not lead to promotions. In my time at CPM/BSSC, my workload has been dominated by tasks that do not lead to promotion. This is in stark contrast to the opportunities that have been offered to my colleagues. The disproportionate amount of time I have spent doing PGTA work is difficult to reconcile with my teaching experience and leadership roles at some of the best institutions in the world. As you may be aware, the UCL Eugenics report has identified this particular pattern as evidence of systemic racism. While my previous line managers have robustly argued that I have not been given opportunities in terms of tasks that lead to promotion because of my “incompetence”, the Eugenics report has recommended (Recommendation 5) that this line of thinking may follow the established ‘normativity’ culture within UCL where a BME person is unfairly perceived as being incompetent. I am quoting recommendation 5 from the Eugenics report below (Inquiry into the History of Eugenics at UCL – Final Report, page 27). “In order to disrupt the ‘normativity’ promoted by eugenics, UCL to establish and invest in a ‘Pipeline to Promotion’ scheme to improve BAME and disabled representation in senior levels of academic staff and professional services. This scheme should begin with an announcement by the Provost of a) an immediate review into BAME staff retention and b) a review to identify BAME or disabled staff members who have been at same level for more than 5 years.” My lack of professional growth at UCL stands in stark contrast to my professional growth at Cambridge. As we begin to approach my 5-year mark at UCL, I have started engaging with different parts of UCL in trying to understand whether UCL’s normativity culture has impeded my professional growth at UCL. While there may have been difficult issues with my previous line managers, I would like to add that you have been exceptional in supporting me since you became my line manager at the start of the academic year. You have taken the time to understand my perspective and I do greatly value your support and advice. While I am always keen to hear and take on board constructive criticism, I have found the circumstances surrounding 0058 extremely difficult to deal with. A course that should not have taken a significant amount of time to teach has taken over my life and made my life extremely difficult in a year that I have struggled with my mental health. I am struggling to deal with the unpredictable bureaucracy which constantly impinges both my research time and mental health. As ever, I feel guilty about taking up so much of your time with such a long email. Over the year, I have hesitated to raise every small issue with you. I had a dawning realisation this week that dealing with small issues over the course of the year has added up to a significant amount of time and overwhelmed me mentally. Hence, this long email and setting out the issues. I do hope that it is a matter that can be amicably resolved with the School and I can go back to the window of research time I had been promised in July and August. If Selcuk or BSSC need to continue to experiment and reinvent 0058 and add bureaucratic hurdles, then they need to find the appropriate resources to do so. If I am to run 0058, then BSSC needs to trust me with the course and we need to return to the atmosphere of consultative collegiality of the previous years. If this proves controversial and BSSC feels the need to escalate this issue to HR or the Dean, I am happy to do so since it captures exactly the point I have been trying to make for the last four years about the issues of workload and culture of normativity at CPM/BSSC. I am happy to do anything reasonable that I am asked to till the time the line-management approach is adhered to, everything that I am asked to do is properly recorded and I am offered the same promotion opportunities that are offered to my colleagues as a matter of due course. I hope that is not too much to ask for. With best wishes, Aniket References: Cunha, Flavio, and James Heckman. “The technology of skill formation.” American Economic Review 97.2 (2007): 31-47.

Certainly that’s not the intention. We’re just trying to get kids supported. Shall you and I have a chat maybe later today? If they’ve already had individualised feedback that should cover that. There is a simple issue of an online quick session. But let’s talk Best 3.3.3 Judy | Workload | 3 March 2022 From: Kumar Aniket &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Fwd: Meeting today Date: 3 March 2022 at 17:27:49 GMT To: &quot;Stephenson, Judy&quot; &lt;j.stephenson@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Bcc: Kumar Aniket &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Dear Judy, Thank you for the chat. I just wanted to clarify the UCL HR policy around the workload issue. Enclosed below is the email below from Gemma Andrews to me dated 25 September 2020. The email was in response to my email dated 8 September 2020 where I had specifically enquired about the teaching workload associated with my job. Since Helen has not clarified the issue despite my repeated request to do so, I had emailed Gemma Andrews on 8th September. In the email, Gemma Andrew states and I quote verbatim from her email below: There is no UCL written policy of a maximum of 6 hours Teaching for Research staff, but its history stems from UKRI guidance found here https://www.ukri.org/files/funding/ukri-fec-grant-terms-and-conditions-guidance-pdf/ The relevant paragraph is RG08. Although not all research staff are covered by these terms (including yourself) for parity we recommend the same maximum. You will see that the 6 hours, includes all relevant admin, preparation and marking etc … I am forwarding Gemma Andrew’s email dated 25 September 2020 along with my email that she was responding to. Her email makes it clear that 6 hours figure includes all relevant admin, preparation and marking time. While there has never been ambiguity regarding this from UCL HR side, the policy within CPM/BSSC has always remained ambiguous. The background to this email is that Stani and I had tried to obtain this information from Helen in August 2020 and failed to get it. I don’t want to raise this issue at this stage and the email is only for information since we often return to this topic in our conversation and it takes up your valuable time. As far as I am concerned, there has never been any ambiguity around this issue. From my perspective, the ambiguity that has been created around the workload issue within CPM/BSSC is intentional and directly related to institutional racism, i.e., to the racial tropes used against people of colour of being lazy and incompetent, not doing their job properly and complaining. The email from Gemma Andrews is only for your eyes and I would be grateful if you don’t share it with anyone at this stage because it is likely to be part of my grievance case. Happy to do my best to clarify anything regarding the emails enclosed below.

Thanks for taking the time and it’s good to see that you are returning to good health. As agreed I’m copying Helen because there’s some procedural stuff in this email. We discussed your occupational health report. Everything in it is accurate apart from the fact that you have told me you do not have workplace stress but that you are suffering from systematic racism at work and that is what you have told occupational health a number of times and they have recorded it as stress. I have sent you the stress risk assessment form but due to the fact that it is racism that is the problem we felt it not appropriate to complete it this afternoon. We talked about the fact that since you do not have any teaching between now and the end of September this gives you time to work on the three papers you want to submit/resubmit to journals by this time. I will consult with Helen on what we do about the stress risk assessment as HR wanted me to have it filled out. And we can formalise goals and things after we know what the situation is with that. You have told me that there are no other issues of going forward. You are aware of that workload for next year will be confirmed early next term. As we only had an hour if there are any other questions or issues that you want to clarify please contact me immediately otherwise I look forward to returning to you about the workplace stress/racism issue.

It is always a pleasure to catch up with you. I can confirm your account of the meeting is accurate. If I could just add the following. I want to confirm that on the three occasions I have spoken to the Workplace health advisors (9 September 2020, 17 December 2021, 28 January 2022) I have been clear in articulating my problem at CPM/BSSC emanating from systemic racism. There is no ambiguity from my side. I am also at a loss to understand how these issues have been conflated. In fact, mis-classifying conflating racism and stress from other sources is itself a instance of systemic racism. Thank you very much Judy for recording the discrepancy.

Someone in the administration seems to have taken a decision to effectively merge the Study Skills courses with 0058. A separate Moodle page was never created for the Study Skills course and now it seems to now be running out of a 0058 page. No submission box has been created for the Study Skills course. Yet, the students have been set a really short four-day deadline for an assignment in the first week that was abruptly changed to a three-day deadline on Monday (today) morning. I have 10 emails from students complaining about Study Skills assignment. A three-day deadline may be fine for a writing course, but it is too short a deadline for an Economics assignment. The students are concerned and confused because the assignment is posted on 0058 page they think it is an Economics assignment. I have spoken to Andy Bone at least 4 times in the last two weeks to coordinate and we get along really well. Given our interest in pedagogy, we understand each other perfectly well. We have both worked hard to coordinate the two courses and the academic side of things have been meticulously worked out between us. It seems CLIE was just following the lead that they had been given from within CPM administration. So, my concern is not with the academic side of the Study Skills course. My concern is with the administration of the Study Skills course within CPM. The key issue is that the learning objectives for the 0058 Economics course and Study Skills course are very different. While students will benefit from coordination between the two courses, giving them a separate identity is extremely important. I know that this is a busy time for you, so I paused for a bit before writing to you. I am only writing to you because I can see that this is going to be a problem and it is best to nip it in the bud. Happy to chat anytime and hear your thoughts on it.

I am having a meeting tomorrow with Andy Wilkinson, and this is at the top of my agenda. I have been observing the correspondence on this and today I checked the Moodle year page for Year 1. I saw that there is a dedicated section there. And as you rightly say, this has been the intention since the very beginning. Having said this, there is an unfortunate wording that might cause confusion on the dedicated space. The diagnosis task is expressed as ‘economics’ task, which is not how we want this to be advertised. I will now send an email to Andy Bones and Andy Wilkinson to pay maximum attention to this. Our meeting with Andy Wilkinson is between 12:30-13:30 tomorrow (Tuesday). Please do join if you are unavailable anytime during the meeting and we can have a chat. Let me know if you can join and I will send you the link. I will be in touch again to see how things are moving forward even if you cannot join the meeting tomorrow. Thank you for your patience and help.

The secondary purpose is to set out in detail the series of crises I have had to cope with due to Andy Wilkinson’s negligent attitude towards the administration of the course. After each crisis, I have had to work hard to reassure the students and regain their trust, only for Andy Wilkinson to create a new crisis. The submission deadline for Term paper for BCPM 0058 is on 1st April. The submission box is not yet up. If past pattern is anything to go by, Andy Wilkinson is unlikely to put up the submission box until the last day. I hope you would appreciate how important it is to create a reliable and reassuring environment for students. It is very important to create a submission box at least a couple of weeks in advance so that early submitters can alert us to any problem that may occur. I can’t imagine any downside to put up the submission box early. The reason I am extremely concerned is because Andy Wilkinson constantly forgets to put up the submission box. The submission deadline for the last term paper was on 7th December. I got a series of panicked emails from students on the 4th December saying that they could not find the submission box. When I contacted Andy, all I got was a nonchalant response saying he had forgotten to put up the box. It is difficult to over-estimate the sense of crisis it creates for the students. The students obviously blame the Module leader for problems like this. Unfortunately, this was not the first time Andy had forgotten. Andy had created an even bigger crisis on the first week of the course. Selcuk had insisted that the Study Skills course (run by Andy Bone) should be run in coordination with BCPM0058. While I had meticulously coordinated the academic content with Andy Bone, the administrative side was Andy Wilkinson’s responsibility. Andy Wilkinson took it upon himself to set a 3-day deadline for the first Study Skills assignment without consulting me or any other academic. Andy made no effort to assess the student’s workload. Further, Andy Wilkinson forgot to set up the submission box. I got around 15 emails in the first couple days of the course complaining that the deadline was unfair and they could not find the submission box. They obviously blamed me for the deadline because no one had bothered to explain to the students that Study Skills was distinct from BCPM0058. It is very difficult to convey the sense of panic this created for the students on the first day of an academic year, a year which all the students were at the edge to start with. The student took to blaming me and I had to work really hard to rebuild the trust. It is a miracle that the student evaluation for BCPM 0058 were so good in spite of crises. Please find attached the email I wrote to Selcuk on the evening of the 5th October, the first day of the teaching term. I am not sure what transpired between Selcuk and Andy Wilkinson. Selcuk wrote an extremely strong email to Andy Bone’s manager blaming him for the crisis. As far as I am concerned, this was an absolutely travesty. Andy Bone had gone over and above his call of duty to set up an extremely good Study Skills course and it was not his responsibility to administer the course. As a result of Selcuk’s email, Andy Bone and CLIE stopped cooperating with me on the BCPM 0058. The Study Skills never worked as it had intended and the students lost out. There have been further small problems through the year like constant flow of emails asking me to make announcement for the course or asking me to change the submission deadline at the last minute. There are numerous other infractions. I don’t think detailing all of Andy Wilkinson’s rudeness and other infractions would serve any purpose. Suffice to say that it has taken a herculean effort on my part to get the course back on track despite the chaos Andy has created. I would be very grateful if we could ensure that the submission box for the term paper goes up at the earliest and Andy Wilkinson can be encouraged to make at least some effort to provide administrative support for the course. The way Andy has behaved over the course of year has not just let me down, he has also let down the hardworking students of BCPM0058 and other members of the Teaching and Learning Team who do such a fantastic job.

When you are completing question 9 please include as much information as possible and be very clear about what type of misconduct you believe has occurred in this instance (i.e. plagiarism v.s. contract cheating). Once you are happy with Part 1 of the form please sign and date the bottom of page 4 as Module Convenor (typing in your name and the date is sufficient for this). Please be aware that the student will be given a copy of this form to review. Please also continue to mark the rest as normal. I do need to release the whole cohorts marks ASAP otherwise we will miss our marking turnaround time. If able can you send this back by tomorrow morning at the latest please?

I have received the following response about the claims. Considering the attached individual claims and evidence provided, a case for academic misconduct cannot be taken forward at this time. If you did want to proceed with it, a more clear analysis of the issue would be required with annotated or highlighted parts of the student’s individual assessment. It maybe useful to refer to the Academic Manual that outlines the basic requirements for evidencing a misconduct case. See: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure The text under section 9.4.2.8 of Chapter 6 reads: In referring a case onto the Departmental Tutor, Departmental Panel, or Academic Misconduct Panel for consideration, the Module Convenor must send the following: An Academic Misconduct Report Form, with Parts 1 and 2 completed (see annex 6.1); A copy of the affected assessment, where applicable annotated or highlighted to identify the extent of the Academic Misconduct. Any other evidence relevant to the case. Due to Judy being involved in the marking process, the role of the Departmental Tutor stated in the regulations is passed to the Chair of the Examination Board. If you do not want to proceed, please complete the marking and feedback for the three students on Moodle. If you could let me know either way of your intention, I would be grateful.

I would suggest providing more details/evidence on the form so that Selcuk and Peter are able to get a better understanding of the alleged plagiarism/contract cheating; this will allow them to question/investigate the situation during the panel. In addition, please do mark the paper and provide the relevant feedback because if the panel does go ahead and decides there is no case of plagiarism/contract cheating then we will need to reinstate the student with feedback/mark immediately.

As you may appreciate, in case of contract cheating, there are only two ways to collected evidence. A viva voce where there is attempt to ascertain whether the student displays any reasonable degree of knowledge that she or he would have acquired while writing the essay. In this case, the benefit of doubt should always favour the student. We employ the services of MI5 or a capable detective agency that can give us direct evidence of contract cheating. As you may appreciate, 2) is impractical at the moment. Hence, I had made the case for further investigation based on my “academic judgement”. If Peter McLennan and Selcuk Cidik are satisfied that all further investigations have been conducted and on balance of probabilities, they have made all effort to ensure that no contract cheating took place then I am happy to mark the exam. However, Peter McLennan and Selcuk Cidik must not use “discretionary principle” to shut down the investigation. They need to exercise “academic judgement” to investigate or find someone who is ready to exercise “academic judgement”. This would require them going through the course material and then reading the essay. Once they have done that and put in writing that they see no cause to investigate further, I am happy to mark.

Andy was correct to signpost you to the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure, with any suspicion of contract cheating/Plagiarism this is the route that UCL advises. Please see the email below from Peter McLennan. Please can you inform Andy and myself how you would all like to proceed. Dear Selcuk Not sure I understand what the issue is given these papers. Unless the module leader can more clearly articulate the issues, I cannot see that there is a case for academic misconduct. The lack of clear analysis of the module leaders points with reference to the coursework does not indicate the need for a viva voce at this time. It would be useful to point the module leader to the Academic Manual that outlines the basic requirements for evidencing a misconduct case. See: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure The text under section 9.4.2.8 of Chapter 6 reads: In referring a case onto the Departmental Tutor, Departmental Panel, or Academic Misconduct Panel for consideration, the Module Convenor must send the following: An Academic Misconduct Report Form, with Parts 1 and 2 completed (see annex 6.1); A copy of the affected assessment, where applicable annotated or highlighted to identify the extent of the Academic Misconduct. Any other evidence relevant to the case. The Module Convenor has not followed this process, so in this instance so we cannot move these cases forward at this time.

So, you could highlight a sentence or a paragraph and add a comment saying, for example, ‘we did not look at this topic in the course, so it is suspicious that the student spent 1/5 of the word count discussing this’. Or something like, ‘we looked at this topic with an emphasis on xxx and yy – however what student is talking about is advanced argument that is not covered in the module or in the reading list’. I hope that this helps clarifying in terms of what is the explanation/evidence that the panel would need to run an effective and fair viva voce. Once you are done with preparing the case, please contact me. I am happy to have a look at them and discuss my opinion with you before we again formally put them in the process and seek for Faculty Tutor’s approval.

I have also partially changed the text in the misconduct form and attached them to the email as a zipped folder. The folders are organised case wise. My text in the misconduct form is very deliberate and I would not like to change it significantly at this stage. The set of reasoning is slightly long and complicated and related to what I see as the ambiguities and shortcomings in the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure and stark punishment for contract cheating. If I had to summarise my argument very briefly, the evidence for customised contract cheating by definition is subjective subject to expertise and I don’t want to try to fit it into an objective evidentiary framework. My understanding from my conversations with Judy was that we will get to the bottom of this within CPM through a framework she had set up last summer. I think what I have written should hopefully be enough for that. I am attaching files for two cases to the email. The files for the third case is too large to send through email. I will send it through the UCL Drop box. Please do let me know if there is any trouble opening the zipped file. If there is trouble opening the files, I can send the file individually. With best wishes, Aniket PS: Ruhana was asking for reference earlier today on contract cheating. Eaton et al (2018) is a very comprehensive article to read on how Universities are dealing (or not dealing in most cases) with contract cheating across the world.

It is my and Ruhana’s understanding of UCL Academic manual that we can’t have an investigation through the framework Judy set up within CPM. I also discussed with Judy yesterday and she was going to talk to Aeli about ways to handling this in CPM moving forward. However, I believe we have all come to an understanding that at the moment that is not an option. Secondly, thank you for the highlighted submissions - I looked at them. My initial observations are as below, but I would like to have a chat with you in order to decide together which cases to uphold and forward to the faculty tutor for approval of a viva voce. Rana Hijazi: This has the highest amount of highlighted text. And the text highlighted seems to be discussing topics of the module in a different way than instructed in the module (right?). So, although I would still like to have a chat with you about this, my view is that there may be enough evidence to create suspicion and conduct an investigatory viva. Yichen Lin: What is highlighted is mainly the paraphrased parts that are referenced. There is 1 sentence that is highlighted and not referenced. So, I understand that your issue is with the references. However, in the coursework brief, you suggest the following: References are only required when quoting material beyond the course material. Looking at the statement above from the coursework brief, my view is that there is not enough evidence to create suspicion and conduct an investigatory viva. But again, I am happy to discuss through it to better understand if there is anything that I am missing here. Jiaqian Huang: There are highlights on paraphrased and other text. The references seem to be coming from a wide range which creates some suspicion. Looking at the poor language, I believe this is student’s own work but my view is that there may be enough evidence to create suspicion and conduct an investigatory viva. I have already sent you an MS Teams message to arrange a time for a chat. Please let me know of your availability as soon as possible. Judy, please do attend our conversation if you would like. Please let us know if you want to join and we will find a time that works for all three of us.

Because the ‘adjudicator’ set out for contract cheating is not the module convenor. This is causing all of us to spend a big amount of time, and we still don’t seem to be in agreement. Can we just not come together for 15 mins (Aniket, Judy, Ruhana, myself) and decide what to do and close this? Tomorrow I am reasonably available and happy to do it. Please let me know.

The implication ( but not explicit statement unfortunately) of the academic manual is that contracts cheating is extremely unlikely to be found, proven and adjudicated immediately. It is more likely to be found to be the case after investigating some other kind of plagiarism. We will clarify this in a dept handbook that someone lucky is going to put together. It should not have gone to Peter without consulting me as Dept tutor. Having Aeli involved or not has nothing to do with this - we skipped a step. That much is clear. And it is the reason why the process with Peter wasted so much time. We did not fully consider what the misconduct was In the department. Over use of words ’contract cheating” which I myself used. Mea a bit culpa. But My impression was we would convene a quick plagiarism panel as per processionals agreed last year. https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.2 In Aniket’s feedback there are sounds for a contract cheating thing - there are grounds for pretty much ALL misconducts. See section 9.2. 2 above. I note that they are 1st years and therefore we have two options open to us given the level of evidence we have. Expedited process. Penalty Table - Flexibility Currently section 9.3 ‘Adjudication and Penalty Guidance’ offers a structured table of penalties to ensure a greater level of consistency across UCL. Feedback provided during 2019-20 highlighted that on some occasions the suggested penalty may be inappropriate. The following has been agreed for 2020-21: In cases where it is felt that the penalty indicated in the guidance table is unsuitable in light of the particular circumstances of a case, an exceptional circumstances application can be made to the Faculty Tutor who, in consultation with the Chair of Academic Misconduct Panel where necessary, can offer approval to deviate from the guidance. Such cases may include, but not limited to: Small amounts of Plagiarism on a highly weighted component, which may then result in a disproportionate penalty of 0% Where the student has already failed the component or module, and an alternative penalty may be more appropriate Cases where there may be an unintended effect on a student’s progression or award OR Poor academic practice 9.4 Procedures 9.4.1 Module Convenor - Poor Academic Practice Where the Module Convenor is presented with evidence of the representation of work or ideas as the student’s own without appropriate referencing or acknowledgement, they must determine whether this amounts to Plagiarism or Poor Academic Practice with reference to 9.2.2 above. Where the Module Convenor deems the evidence to amount to Poor Academic Practice, they must take the following action to address this: Require the student to undertake UCL’s Introduction to Academic Integrity course; and Require the student to meet with the Departmental Tutor, Departmental Graduate Tutor or Programme Leader to discuss the Poor Academic Practice and receive warning that any further instances of Poor Academic Practice would be deemed to amount to Academic Misconduct and penalised as outlined in 9.3; and Require the student to present the work in question with corrections to address all of the Poor Academic Practice. If the student fails to present such work the matter will be dealt with as one of plagiarism. Presenting the corrected work will not count as another assessment ‘attempt’. The original mark awarded to the work prior to the corrections being made will stand but will only be entered formally on the record once the corrected version of the work has been presented. Ensure that the Poor Academic Practice is recorded on the module minutes in Portico. Let’s go for the second ?? IF ONLY BECAUSE ITS IN BLACK AND WHITE IN FRONT OF US FROM THE MANUAL ???? Please let me know you are all happy to proceed with poor academic practice - or expedited process if you object. BEST Dr Judy Z.

I spent as much, perhaps more, time on this, and I am very busy too. What I am trying to do is to deal with this following the respective procedures. Since the very beginning I am saying one thing: let’s decide what the allegation is and follow the process. Second, as long as the concern is ‘poor academic practice’, then I do not, and cannot, have any objection for Aniket to follow ‘Poor Academic Practice’ route that you quoted in your email below. It is in module convenor’s discretion to start and apply the process as instructed in the academic manual. Having said that, I want to highlight the definition of ‘poor academic practice’ taken from UCL Academic Integrity website (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/academic-integrity): Poor Academic Practice Poor Academic Practice is the failure to follow the referencing and citation conventions for your discipline because you have not yet received guidance or training on how to do this. If this is the case, UCL may view any referencing and citation mistakes in your work more leniently and not as Academic Misconduct. You will be given the opportunity to meet your department to discuss your work, take UCL’s ‘Introduction to Academic Integrity’ course, and present the piece of work again with the relevant corrections to address the issues. Aniket, if this is the process that you are following, can you please share the procedure with the students when you let them know about the allegation. Also, I would be happy to meet them and talk to them if you would like me to.

We will make an appointment of someone to own the process more generally in the dept. I have already provided the definitions ? And also the process. Therefore, it almost looked like you were making further modification to the process, but I am sure you are not. If Aniket is ok with referring is as poor academic practice - he will as per previous email mark the scripts and they will be returned according to the process set out in 9.4.1 below. Very happy for you to be at the meeting w the students too as part of this process. It’s to help them. Aniket let me know if you are happy. FT(AR) and PMcL are aware of process.

I just did not quite get what the students will be asked to do as part of point ‘iii’. So, I looked for a more comprehensive definition of ‘poor academic practice’ to better understand what they will need to do when they revise their work under ‘iii’. Based on the definition that I found, and the statement under ‘iii’ (“the case will be treated as plagiarism in case student fails to revise”), my understanding is that the students should mainly be asked to properly reference/cite their work when they revise it. So, I haven’t understood how this will help addressing Aniket’s concerns, which are not about referencing/citations. This is the only reason I shared that definition.

Secondly, as the definition you provide as well as the academic manual’s procedure makes clear the process implies that the student will be given direction on what to do. In detail: Again, I’m a little bit confused about what the confusion is - Is it because you are querying whether we are alleging contract cheating or other academic misconduct or poor academic practice? Is it because there is some other kind of confusion? Here I clarify again. The essays that Aniket has pulled out have lots of indications of either somebody else having written them or plagiarism. Those indications are that they don’t reflect the course material and they use language and terminology that is found possibly from another source. These indications could be used as suspicion of contract cheating. That was our suspicion. Like everybody has spotted here there is not enough evidence to support a claim of contract cheating at the moment- this happens a lot and it’s not surprising. Please note my clarification from the earlier email “Contract cheating can only be referred up by the departmental panel. https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.4 9.4.5. The implication ( but not explicit statement unfortunately) of the academic manual is that contract cheating is extremely unlikely to be found, proven and adjudicated immediately. It is more likely to be found to be the case after investigating some other kind of plagiarism.” (this interpretation has been discussed with higher powers by the way, therefore, it will be clarified in some kind of department guide as I also indicated earlier). So, in answer to how will the students know what to do: in the meeting ii) We will be asking the students to to tell us about how they wrote the essay and why they used the terminology they did. We will highlight what we thought was poor and indicated bad practice, there will be an encouraging and supportive conversation that tells them how to change this , so iii) can happen and then write in their own words without paraphrasing any other source, an answer to the question that’s clearly engages with the course material rather than any other source. Without knowing exactly what the indications of paraphrasing, use of terminology from other popular management sources, use of terminology similar to other submitted or familiar work are a result of we had two options – to proceed under the expedited process on submissions of plagiarism, or to proceed with poor academic practice because they were first years. The goal of either a departmental panel informal Viva voce, which would be the result of the expedited process or the poor academic practice process is to find out from the students why they are producing work like this and help them to improve and write their own original work. The poor academic practice process is laid out below clearly states what is to happen and what the steps are. I hope that this email has cleared up any confusion that might still the present?

Let’s proceed this way then. Aniket, in the end, you will decide which cases to bring forward. However, having seen your highlighted student work and the assessment brief, my personal opinion is that Yichen Lin’s case may deserve a second look before putting the student through the process. I am copying my previous comments about this student below: Yichen Lin: What is highlighted is mainly the paraphrased parts that are referenced. There is 1 sentence that is highlighted and not referenced. So, I understand that the issue is the references used in the submission. However, in the coursework brief, you suggest the following: References are only required when quoting material beyond the course material. Looking at the statement above from the coursework brief, my view is that there is not enough evidence to suggest any problem. Finally, as long as Ruhana is happy with this, Aniket can you please complete the marking as soon as possible, so that we can release the marks to all students.

I want to restrain myself from writing anything at this stage because I don’t want to pre-judge. This is also the reason why I have been cautioning against pre-judgement. The evidence is subject to expertise and it is easy to misread the evidence if read without the expertise. This is why, at this stage, it is subjective evidence and should not be read like objective evidence. Every word I have written in mis-conduct form has meaning. Once this is over, I am happy to explain my reasoning in detail. When I do so, it would be clear why Yichen Lin case is so complicated.

On the Team’s channel you will see the uploaded assessment marksheet with Turnitin paper numbers. Please update the spreadsheet on Teams (rather than downloading a copy) so that all markers are working on the same version. I have allocated the 1st and 2nd marking on the assessment marksheet on Teams as per the Module leader allocation doc here on BCPM0008 Assessment marksheet Please note there is a change to the second marking process. We are no longer using the 2nd marking form. The 2nd marker provides feedback notes on the assessment marksheet and notifies the 1st marker once completed. Please see the process attached above. The numbers that are in red on the spreadsheet are late submissions. Results are to be released to the students by 24th May 2021. There are 4 students that have not submitted at present. Three of these student’s have a 1-week or 2-weekk EC. I will update the schedule of assessment marksheet as the remaining students submit. In addition, I will be sending an email through Moodle to the student that has not submitted to remind them to do so. Please email me once the marking is finalised and agreed, could you ensure the assessment marksheet on the Teams channel is updated and accurate so that the Teaching and Learning team can do their checks, before results are released to the students. If you think that a penalty needs to be applied to any of the assessments please discuss this first and/or add a note on the marksheet, this is to ensure that penalties are applied consistently across the module. Do not worry about applying any late submission penalties as I will do this before the marks are released. If you have any questions about the marking process please let us know.

I did not see any submissions that would pass our usual academic misconduct test. A few borderline cases but I don’t think they are worth pursuing. The same applies to word counts.

I spent the last two days trying to find a way so that we can 1) award marks that are fair to the students and 2) without elongating the process further. It seemed to me that the fairest way would be for me to blind-second marks the whole set and provide a clear rationale for the marks I have awarded. (See below my simple marking framework.) My marks and comments are attached in the file titled “Aniket’s_marks_comments.pdf”. Also attached is a figure titled “0008_marks_graph.pdf”. This contains a graphical representation of Niko and my marks (blind second marking). The blue points are the ones where the variation between Niko and my marks are large and require third marking by Judy. It is great that Judy has stepped in to adJudycate as the third marker (pun fully intended :-) ). I have updated my marks on the excel file in Teams. (I have left out the comments for now, since my long comments mess up the layout.) I have also created a column that indicates whether the script requires the third marker in my opinion. Happy to add or take away scripts as needed from this list. For the rest, I presume we can just take the average. Judy - all this requires is looking at my Niko’s feedback (Moodle) and my feedback (attached file) and determining the mark. I am very happy to go along with Judy’s decisions. So, it can be done straight on Teams excel sheet. Once we are done with this, Niko may need to change this feedback. Some of his feedback is a variance with the term paper brief (available on 0008 Moodle page since March) or UCL marking policies. The ones I noticed are given below. Remove comments about students being penalised for citations. The term paper brief (available since March) clearly says citations are not required. Feedback that suggests that students are being penalised because there is a suspicion of plagiarism. If there is a suspicion of plagiarism, it needs to be raised separately and the requisite process needs to be followed. Students cannot be penalised for suspicion of plagiarism through the normal process of marking. Feedback that suggests that students are being penalised for focussing or giving examples from any particular country. There is nothing in the term paper brief that prevents students from using examples of a country. I will leave it to Niko’s discretion on what he wants to change. I have a big deadline looming on 21st May. I have already spent an inordinate amount of time on this. I am hoping that we can proceed smoothly by doing our bits on the excel sheet. As I said, I am happy to go along with whatever Judy decides on the marks. Apologies for this long 543 words email. Hope it is useful! With best wishes, Aniket --- My framework for marking was as follows: Has the student explained how infrastructure can raise income per-capita in a country through various channels?

If the second marker doesn’t agree on any one mark then full second marking must be carried out. My understanding from your email is that this has happened. Great. Next: First and second markers must reconcile. Where are you are less than 10% apart you can split the difference- unless it goes across a grade boundary. Other than that marks must be reconciled through discussion of the criteria. When the third marker is called in – thats me and I do like the pun – the third marker’s “role is not to override the two previous markers but to contribute to resolving the discussion with reference to the marking criteria”. So unfortunately… This is not about me determining the mark. I agree this would be quicker. James can you grant me access to the teams box for the spreadsheet so I can see the marks and where there is disagreement. Before doing so, Niko can you confirm that any marking down for citations, plagiarism, or a reference to a particular country has been resolved in your marks, as these things do seem to have been given to the students as part of the brief. We will need the broken down marks in each marking criteria category for both markers. Whilst I review please continue to attempt to reconcile as, unfortunately in this case, that is the means by which the academic manual directs us to mark.

I also rephrased the comment about copying and pasting large chunks of text from somebody else’s work without interpretation. I hope this helps but I will speak to James about the misconduct form. Judy, I think it’s ready for you. Many thanks for your help! I think the major difference between mine and Aniket’s comments is that he focuses mostly on knowledge and understanding while in my feedback this is only 50% of the mark. best, Niko From: &quot;Allie, James&quot; &lt;j.allie@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Re: 0008 marking: reconciling the marks Date: 20 May 2021 at 09:44:37 BST To: &quot;Szumilo, Nikodem&quot; &lt;n.szumilo@ucl.ac.uk&gt;, &quot;Stephenson, Judy&quot; &lt;j.stephenson@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Cc: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Good morning all, Thanks for keeping me in the loop.

Ted Hastings’ favourite line about diesel comes to mind. :-) (please ignore this if you are not a Line of Duty fan) I have averaged Niko’s and my marks and then rounded them off on the Team excel spreadsheet. In most cases, the results seemed fair and reasonable to me. I have identified two cases where we should have Judy look at it (lines with gray background). 150518270: Niko 43, Aniket 80, Average: 61.5. Given the large difference, it would be prudent if Judy can have a look and see if we need to move in one direction or other. 150366752: Niko 63, Aniket 74, Average 68.5. It is close to the class boundary and an umpire call from Judy would be very useful. Judy, please find attached my detailed comments and the breakdown of marks for these two cases in the attached pdf. For the rest of cases, I am happy to go with the averages unless Niko wants to flag up any more cases. As I said, to me the averages look pretty reasonable in all cases but the two aforementioned cases. Hope this is useful!

I am taking it that Aniket is proposing that the marks in the agreed mark column are the compromise or reconciliations. As some of the marks were more than 20 marks apart Niko could you also confirm that you have criteria reasons to be happy with the marks that are now in the spreadsheet as agreed or if you want to suggest another compromise do so. I am going to look at the two that are highlighted as not agreed now and return with some comments.

But, I have spent the last few hours feeling extremely guilty. It is about 150518270. I told all my students again and again to write sharp, crisp analytical term papers. 150518270 has written an essay that is very similar to the answer guide that I wrote. Every important point that I stress on in the answer guide is there in the term paper. I just feel really guilty that I gave them wrong advice about how to write a term paper. Having said that, I would absolutely abide by Judy’s advice on both papers.

It has been brought to my attention that two BCPM008 assignments submissions should be highlighted to you (as the module leader) as there could be cases of academic misconduct.

The question forces the student into original thinking and makes plagiarism difficult. Having said that, I have looked through all the scripts for plagiarism and contract cheating and at least I didn’t pick up any alarming signals. Below are my initial thoughts on the two cases you have flagged up. Making a case requires forensic analysis of the term paper and establishing that plagiarism has compromised the originality of the term paper. I am absolutely happy to support you if you want to make a case for any of them. Judy - you are an expert on this. Please do correct me if I have misunderstood what we need to do to make a plagiarism case. Hope this is helpful!

I am currently applying for the MPhil in Real Estate Finance at the University of Cambridge and wondered if you could write my reference? I have realised that the deadline for funding (2nd December) is much sooner than the application deadline. However, they require us to have everything sent by the funding deadline. - I appreciate that this is a tight deadline, any help you can be offer would be greatly appreciated.

Unfortunately, I am right on medical leave after an accident. Given the short deadline, I don’t think it would be possible for me to get the reference done. I have done a reference for other students who had asked me weeks ago. Unfortunately, the timeframe is really short and with my illness I can work for really short periods. Hope you can find someone else to write the reference for you. With best wishes, K.A.

For the second occasion this year, we noticed that you did not attend more than 50% of face-to-face lectures this week. Could you reply to your personal tutor (Aniket Kumar) and I and let us know the reason for your recent unauthorised absence please? If you cannot contact your personal tutor, I have included your Year tutor (Laura Florez-Perez) in this email. Please ensure that you return to face-to-face teaching with immediate effect. All the missed learning material with some live session’s recordings available are available on Moodle. Please do not hesitate to use any Student Support and Wellbeing services available, if needed or contact your personal tutor. This email is part of Stage 2 of the non/low attendance procedure stated within the Attendance Policy. Failure to reply to this email and give a valid reason for your absence will result in the department escalating the matter as discussed in the Attendance Policy. Looking forward to hearing from you. Kind regards Andy Wilkinson (he/him/his) Teaching and Learning Administrator Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction, UCL From: &quot;Aniket, Kumar&quot; &lt;k.aniket@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Fwd: UCL – RESPONSE REQUIRED - Stage 2 - Low Attendance to during Week 8 (W.C. 29th November 2021) Date: 12 December 2021 at 15:56:05 GMT To: &quot;Pascoe, Helen&quot; &lt;h.pascoe@ucl.ac.uk&gt;, &quot;Begum, Ruhana&quot; &lt;ruhana.begum@ucl.ac.uk&gt;, &quot;Stephenson, Judy&quot; &lt;j.stephenson@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Cc: &quot;Florez Perez, Laura&quot; &lt;l.florez@ucl.ac.uk&gt; Dear Helen, Judy and Ruhana, I would like to draw your attention to the email below, sent out to Gift Kalua on Saturday 11th December 2021 at 5:50PM. I am really concerned about the email, especially the use of threats as a starting point, without first trying a more humane approach. I am also not sure that it is appropriate to send out such an email 36 hours before the government is moving to “Plan B” and encouraging people to work from home. The ideal approach would be to try a humane approach to first find out why Gift Kalua has missed face to face teaching and then find the best way forward. This can only be done if the process goes through the Personal Tutor. In the past, there was a humane approach at CPM, but the institutional memory of that humane approach has been wiped out. I have been extremely concerned and repeatedly voiced my concerns that the previous humane approach has been replaced by the Kafkaesque approach of issuing threats first and asking questions later, thus alienating the students in this difficult period. Turns out, I have actually been in touch with Gift Kalua through my illness. I have done this because I take my role as a personal tutor very seriously. Gift seemed very engaged in an email conversation with me towards the end of November 2021. Gift is applying to the MPhil in Real Estate Finance at the University of Cambridge and asked me to write an academic reference. Given that Gift’s request for the reference came one week before the deadline and I was already struggling with a long list of references I had promised my students and personal tutees before my illness, I explained that in this instance, it would be difficult to write a reference given my illness. Gift seemed very concerned about my illness, even offered to help if I needed anything. Gift’s response really touched me. This was a humane conversation where trust was renewed between the Personal Tutor and Tutee. The students know that they can trust me because I would go out of my way to help them. Frankly, at this stage, I don’t know why Gift Kalua’s attendance is below the required amount. I could find out, encourage Gift to attend and make a call about what needs to be done if I am allowed to function as a personal tutor. I find it very difficult to develop relationships of trust where I am constantly bypassed as a personal tutor and there is a language of control and threats that I have never experienced hitherto in my two-decades-long experience of being a personal tutor at Cambridge, Edinburgh and LSE. It is important to recognise how stressful this period for all students and any communication from BSSC should not exacerbate any mental health issues students are experiencing. If a student is burdened or depressed, the email below can easily be a trigger. Recognising that a student could be in a precarious state of mental health is extremely important and I am really disappointed to find that such emails are still being sent out on behalf of the Department. I would be very grateful if the email to Gift Kalua and other such emails are retracted and a more humane email is sent out and encouraging Gift and other students to do their best in the circumstances. It is also important to recognise that within days of the first Omicron case in London being identified, 30% of Covid-19 cases in London are being attributed to the Omicron variant. With such explosive growth of Omicron cases, an email threatening students with the consequence if they do not attend face-to-face teaching will not age well as this new wave progresses. With the Government encouraging people to work from home, I really cannot see how as the email puts it, the department would “escalate” the matter. I have copied Laura as the year’s tutor.

We have 100% attendance requirement in the department this year because of the long tail of complaints, appeals, and student support caseload (with enormous consequences for everybody) that emerges when we do not follow up on attendance problems. What you may perceive as Kafka -esque is actually part of our much bigger, more comprehensive, and very human approach to welfare generally in the department - to have some proper systems and processes so that there cannot be any favouritism, or discrimination, and to ensure people do not ‘slip through the net’. The process outlined below is what the academic manual dictates. I will have a look and see if we can do anything about wording et cetera but generally this is good procedure - however I completely understand why you are raising what you are. Andy works tirelessly to follow up on each and every student and when he leaves the department at the end of this month we will be making sure that we have somebody else who can bring a similar amount of compassion, humour, and pastoral care to that role. I did not realise that your personal tutees were contacting you and that we had not dealt with this through your illness. I will check on what the backup arrangements for this are. In the meantime please be assured that the email you have seen is procedural, appropriate, and is not the only contact the student will have had. If you have any questions about anything at all in relation to this don’t hesitate to contact me.
