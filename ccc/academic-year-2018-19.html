I wrote my email because of what I had been told by Helen Pascoe and D’Maris Coffman. It became clear to me from Prof Penn’s response that the objective of the meeting was to ensure that I don’t contact Prof Penn. It put me in a difficult position because Prof Penn had always expressed interest in my research ideas and strongly advised me to keep seeing him on the regular basis. Prof Coffman had warned me again and again not to see him. 11 December Meeting was warning sign to me of the extent to which Prof Coffman and Ms Helen Pascoe would go to me to ensure that I don’t contact him.</td>

All I was trying to do is find a way so that John Kelsey would not fail the students again. I had a very strong feeling even then that they had not been failed for purely academic reasons. Four years later, my conviction that the marking process was not above board remains as strong as ever and CPM/BSSC has not learnt from the episode in 2018.</td>

<td align="left">Quote from Grant Mills’ email: “As I can see from your email to the student, you have accepted responsibility for: inadequate teaching, unfair marking and second marking, inadequate supervision and you have also told the student that they are “not the best” and you are unwilling to supervise them on legal and moral ground.” Grant Mills had asked me to sort out the crisis in 0052. It was a crisis that I had been trying to avert for weeks, but no one was ready to listen. Once the large contingent of students came to complain about John Kelsey on around 29 November 2018, suddenly I became the focus of everyone’s effort. Grant Mills characterisation of the situation is deeply unfair. There were obviously conversations going in the background and there was an effort divert the attention from the impending crisis in 0052. While I had made a mistake in copying in the student, I had accepted fully responsibility, the issue was not being seen as a honest mistake. In stead, the issue was being weaponised to make sure I keep quiet about the problems within BSSC. <hi>I am fairly certain that this is a case of stereotyping, i.e., where people of colour raise issues, it seen as both aggressive and challenging the entitlement of the privileged group. People of colour are tolerated if they are servile and submissive. If they show agency, then there is immediate need to sort them out and ensure that they know their place.</hi> I have tried my best to remain a force for good in spite all the opposition I have faced over the years at CPM/BSSC. I, along with my contributions, remain invisible. Conversely, there are constant efforts to oppose my effort to improve teaching standards at BSSC.</td>

<p>Dear Dr. Aniket,</p>
<p>I have finished my first draft of my dissertation. And of course it is still need to be modified. Although I didn’t add references in the paper, the other parts are all in a preliminary shape. </p>
<p>It would be great if you can give me some comments on the logics and content. </p>
<p>Attached is my first draft.</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply! Thank you so much.</p>

<p>Dear Cecilia,</p>
<p>I have looked at your  dissertation. You need to work a bit more on your Methodology (section 3) and Analysis and Result (Section 4). Basically, it not clear what is x. How is it calculated. Then its relationship with Boston Matrix and Bowman’s Strategic Clock is not clear. Basically, you need to be much clearer in explaining how you are getting x and then from that getting the z. Without that, it is not clear what this has to do with market potential.</p>
<p>I also don’t understand what “status quo of infrastructural construction performance” means.</p>
<p>Basic idea about  </p>
<p>Best wishes,
K.A.</p>

<p>Dear Dr. Kumar,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email!</p>
<p>I have done some modification about my dissertation, especially in terms of your advice. </p>
<p>The yellow highlight is the part I modified in terms of the questions in your last email. I hope I have explained clearly for such questions and it is easy for you to check that.</p>
<p>Basically, the “infrastructural construction” is a typo. The infrastructure construction performance, as a variable that refers to the level of development of the infrastructure construction industry, will be explained by the scores that obtained from the calculations. The calculations part are emphasized in analysis section.</p>
<p>As the basis for the classification of market types, the infrastructure construction performance of each country will be regarded as the variable x in the three-dimensional Boston Matrix; and the variable y and variable z refer to the infrastructure market space and level of risks, respectively. The infrastructure market potential of such countries is thus reflected by the classification result, shown by the Boston Matrix.</p>
<p>As for the relationship with Boston Matrix and Bowman’s strategic model, I think there are not some special relationship between them. I use the Boston Matrix to do the classification of infrastructure market in terms of different market potential. And I just use the Bowman’s strategic model to do the classification of the entry modes.</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice again! If there are more questions, please don’t hesitate to tell me.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to your reply.:)</p>

<p>Dear Aniket/Peter</p>
<p>Thank you both for your efforts with this.</p>
<p>I think we have a fundamental disagreement about this dissertation. However part of this may be to do not only with an understandable reluctance to fail a dissertation but also an understanding of where the pass/fail line is drawn.</p>
<p>I attach my Blind Marking sheet. Basically my take on this is as flows:-</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The ‘research question(s)’ as such are far too broad, generic and ill-defined.</li>
<li>Altman’s z-scores are irrelevant for examining either market potential or mode of entry (they might however be useful for certain types of investors and/or clients as part of their risk analysis).</li>
<li>The BCG matrix is very old hat. It is now often omitted from the latest editions of marketing textbooks. A study in 1992 found that companies using it actually had lower returns than other similar companies. It is best applied anyway to consumer goods and services. Essentially infrastructure is not a business-to-consumer set of markets nor even a business-to-business set but rather business-to-government. Not only that but there is a great diversity of bundling, risk allocation and procurement modes. This makes it extremely difficult to judge profitability and market share (except possibly for tier 2 and below subcontractors and suppliers). Finally many infrastructure procurement deals involve what are essentially-built-in financial deals and it was agreed from the beginning that BCG analysis cannot sensibly be used where finance is involved because of the complexity of valuing financial products and companies.</li>
<li>The quantitative method which appears to be used is that of multi-discriminant z-scores which is a statistical techniques completely separate from Altman’s model which is essentially a weighted linear multi-factor model (although the statistical justification for its use derives from the multi-discriminant model). One of the problems is then that all the references to Altman in the text are irrelevant in terms of justifying the use of this technique.</li>
<li>The input data for the model apparently comes from a World Bank publication which is not in the Reference List. This is fatal. One of the things that is necessary is that any examiner ought in theory be able to re-perform the calculations shown in the dissertation. If this cannot be done then by definition the dissertation is basically unexaminable. However the problem is compounded here because the nature of the input data lacks any sort of basic clarity or explanation.</li>
<li>Accordingly one can then see that the literature review is essentially irrelevant in addressing the research questions such as they are.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the essential pass/fail questions is ‘does this dissertation make a reasonable even if poorly executed attempt to do what it says on the tin?’ In this case we have a number of tins with illegible writing and only a hammer with which to open them.</p>
<p>I am sorry to be so brutally honest but there is no way I can put this before the external examiner Prof. Bernard Vogl and say that this is a UCL MSc dissertation of pass standard.</p>
<p>Looking at the student’s scores for her taught modules it is clear that she does not have well-developed quantitative skills but has some quite good marks in her management modules. My recommendation is therefore that the re-submission should focus on some form of qualitative research.</p>
<p>Kind regards <br>
John</p>

<p>Dear John,</p>
<p>Student Number: 17054595</p>
<p>I am Chen Li, from CEM. I have informed that I have failed the MSc Dissertation just now. I felt so depressed and worried about my MSc dissertation. I will definitely resubmit the dissertation for examination by 23rd January 2019. Because I desire to get my master degree to complete my education in UCL, therefore, I will work harder in this second time. But now, I am quite confused what I need to do right now. And I still have several questions and hope to get some suggestions from you.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I am wondering do I need to change my dissertation topic, or do I need to stick to my original topic and rewrite?</li>
<li>Actually, I have contacted my dissertation supervisor (Dr. Kumar Aniket) very often during the third semester. And I have sent my first draft and second draft to him and got some positive feedback from me. But I got this mark which makes me shock. So I am wondering in this second time, can I have a second professor to help me. It is my first time to fail a paper or work, I really feel worried and really desire to get my master degree and</li>
<li>If I passed my dissertation in the second time, will I get my master degree delayed?</li>
<li>I am wondering if I have to pay extra fee for the second submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you so much!! I look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>I can answer your questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You should stick with your original topic and re-work it</li>
<li>You should work with Dr. Kumar Aniket. It may not be possible to assign another supervisor due to staff shortage</li>

<p>Dear Kumar,</p>
<p>I am Chen Li, from CEM. I have informed that I have failed the MSc Dissertation yesterday. I felt so depressed and worried about my MSc dissertation. I will definitely resubmit the dissertation for examination by 23rd January 2019. Because I desire to get my master degree to complete my education in UCL, therefore, I will work harder in this second time. It is my first time to fail a paper or work, I really feel worried and really desire to get my master degree.</p>
<p>As I asked professor John and Natalya, I am informed that I still need to rework my dissertation with your help. Because we have discussed my dissertation very often, I think you will be the only and best one to help me rewrite my dissertation. I would appreciate if you can give me some suggestions about my edited work when I send it to you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!! Attached is my feedback of the board of examiners.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Chen</p>

<p>Dear John,</p>
<p>I am Chen Li, from CEM. I was informed that my dissertation has failed on last Wednesday. Honestly I felt so worried and had no ideas what to do next until I emailed you to ask some questions and Natalya gave me the answers. She suggested me to contact with my supervisor (Dr. Kumar Aniket) as soon as possible. Actually, I did it. But unfortunately, Dr Kumar Aniket has not replied me by now. </p>
<p>I am sorry to interrupt you. Actually I have emailed him several times last week. But I still didn’t get any reply. So I don’t know how can I get in touch with him now?</p>
<p>Thank you so much! Sorry for interrupting you again.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I had look over her dissertation and the problem is I just understand what she has done or what she wants to do. As I had mentioned when we were marking, I had tried to get her to do something Economics related that I understand. She insisted on doing something Finance related, which I just don’t understand.</p>
<p>So, I have no idea what to tell her since I don’t understand anything about the area. There are a lot of thing I can supervise, but Finance is something that is beyond my abilities.  </p>
<p>Natalya wrote something about staff shortage, but I think this is more of a pastoral care issue and giving Chen Li a fighting chance of pass her MSc.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Aniket</p>

<p>The programme leader for CEM is Dr Natalya Sergeeva. Your supervisor is Dr Aniket Kumar.</p>
<p><hi>I therefore have no standing in this matter. Additionally I am now programme leader for PEM and I have quite enough to do dealing with PEM students who have failed their dissertation.</hi></p>

<p>Dear Natalya,</p>
<p>There is a bit of story behind this, which I am not sure whether you are aware of. I am an Economist, with some very rudimentary knowledge of finance. I supervised Chen Li over the year. She is not be the best student, but met with her frequently and supervised her as best as I could.</p>
<p>When I marked her dissertation, I didn’t think it was great, but I thought she should have passed with a below average mark. John insisted that Li, Chen and another student Xu, Tiantian should fail. He had a very specific idea about what methodology they should have used.</p>
<p>That is when I realised <hi>John is teaching very specific methodology, which is entirely different from what I am trained in. I literally don’t understand even the basic of this methodology that is being taught. I also don’t understand why she failed. I have twenty years of teaching experience, so I am supremely confident that I know everything there is to know in Economics. Unfortunately, Finance is an entirely unrelated field that I know very little.</hi></p>
<p>Given this situation, <hi>I have no idea how to advise Li, Chen or Xu, Tiantian to change her dissertation and resubmit so that she can pass. In this, I would be entirely unethical of me and CPM to assign her to me, knowing fully well that both of them are going to fail.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I take my responsibility to the students and CPM very seriously. In this case, since I am entirely incapable of giving her any useful advice, I would be doing something very unethical in continuing to supervise her.</hi></p>
<p>Further, <hi>I hope you understand that there is legal angle to this. If Li, Chen and Xu, Tiantian fail, then we at CPM would have failed to undertake our duty of care towards the students. So, there could be legal complications. So, I would urge you think about these two cases very carefully before you make a decision.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I have emailed John and Ruhana about this. Ruhana has taken this up with Victoria. I want this to be taken seriously and I will push back on this because I think me supervising Li, Chen and Xu, Tiantian is unethical.</hi></p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Aniket,</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me know. I understand your point.</p>
<p>It happens with all of us that we supervise students who choose different methodologies and theories which we are not necessarily experts in the field. We seek additional support from colleagues, where necessary, who are experts in the field. We normally continue to be supervisor of the students who fail.</p>
<p>I’ll consult with colleagues on this issue.</p>

<p>Dear Natalya,</p>
<p>I am sorry but may <hi>the import of my email was not clear.</hi> Let me state it more clearly.</p>
<p>The point is this. <hi>The students are not being properly taught methodology in the course, which would help them write dissertations. Yet, they are being examined as if they were taught properly.</hi></p>
<p>What I am pointing out is that <hi>there is big big problem in the Economic and Finance dissertations that needs to be looked at very carefully. As it stands, it is arbitrary and unfair to students who were not previously trained in methodology.</hi></p>
<p><hi>This is not about me needing help. This is about the dissertation programme needing help.</hi></p>
<p>I can also assure you that <hi>I have thought long and hard before bringing this up. This is not about me supervising a couple of students. It would take me no time to do that and I would happily do it if there was no issue at hand. This is about FAIRNESS to the students that UCL owes them.</hi></p>

<p>Dear Kumar,</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>Thank you for your email. I appreciate that you can let me know the story behind this. I am sorry for saying that you are lack of input before, as I didn’t know what was happening behind this.</p>
<p>Honestly, I truly appreciate your help for my dissertation. And I totally understand what you have said in your email, including not continuing to supervise me. Now, I just feel disappointed and worried about my dissertation because it seems like it is hard for me to pass my dissertation and graduate from UCL. I truly desire to get my master degree and it is really important to me, indeed. So I will continue contacting Natalya and the cpm to ask for a feedback.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you for helping me say something to Natalya. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Have a nice weekend.</p>

<p>I am really sorry but I don’t understand the game theory paper at all. The author seems confused between what is an Nash equilibrium and what just a outcome. Both games have a simple Nash which is Pareto optimal. This is not a game of chicken. These are games where Pareto and Nash coincide. The paper does not even discuss equilibria.</p>
<p>As someone who knows game theory well, I am very very uncomfortable adding something like this to the reading list.</p>

<p>Dear Grant,</p>
<p>In case, you want to see why the students are complaining and why I am extremely sleep deprived and at my wits end with John’s BCPM0052 course, here is what tomorrow lecture (Lecture 4) looks like.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>120 lecture slides. See <a href="http://aniket.co.uk/b/0052w4/Lecture_52w4.pptx" class="uri">http://aniket.co.uk/b/0052w4/Lecture_52w4.pptx</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Readings total 464 pages. See <a href="http://aniket.co.uk/b/0052w4/Reading_52w4.pdf" class="uri">http://aniket.co.uk/b/0052w4/Reading_52w4.pdf</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The lecture covers material that the Economics department at UCL is taking one full term to cover, that too with Economics students.</p></li>
<li><p>Lecture slides full of mistakes and based on material not taught. E.g. slide 43, he has mistaken the wage curve as the labour supply curve. One of many catastrophic mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>The suggested topics for discussion are cryptic and enigmatic at best, with no indication for tutors as to what he expects. See <a href="http://aniket.co.uk/b/0052w4/Topics_52w4.docx" class="uri">http://aniket.co.uk/b/0052w4/Topics_52w4.docx</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All the lecture required was 30-40 slides and about 60-100 pages of reading.</p>
<p>Sorry for bothering you with this, but I needed to document the description of at least one lecture, because no one seems to believe me when I tell them what a disaster this course is.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Aniket</p>

<p>Aniket,</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me know and sorry for the delay - I was in meeting much on Monday and Tuesday. <hi>We really appreciate your involvement. Because you know the depth of the subject areas, I can understand that it may feel like this is not creating an ideal environment for the students.</hi></p>
<p><hi>At this point we just need to get to the end of the module and to deliver it professionally. The last session I imagine will have to be scaled done considerably / because much of the material has been covered, so this may be the last week where you come across the issue.</hi></p>
<p><hi>We have in place a module SEQ, so we will get clear feedback on these problems. We may also need to do a post-mortem on some core modules and we would really appreciate your involvement in that.</hi></p>

<p>Hi Grant!!!</p>
<p>Sure, happy to do a post-mortem once we are done. My tutorial seems to have gone off fine and students really seem to like it.</p>
<p>I just got a semi-threatening email from D’Maris regarding the dissertation issue. I have serious concerns about the way John over-ruled Peter Hansford (second-marker) and me (first-maker) on the dissertation. Both Peter and I thought that the student should have passed but John insisted that they should fail. I think you are likely to get dragged into this if you have not already been.</p>
<p>D’Maris claims I am making baseless accusations about John. All I want is what is best for my students, that is they should get a fair grade and not be penalised for something that is not their fault.</p>
<p>Helen and D’Maris wanted my concerns in writing. I have written a short report of how things transpired with the relevant email in it. I am sending it to you as well. From my perspective, the email chain should raise concerns, especially the fact that John over-ruled both the first and second marker.</p>
<p>In our meeting to reconcile the dissertation marks in October, John told me that I was not qualified to judge the dissertation and that is why he was over-ruling me. That is what I told Natalya. Now he claims that I am entirely qualified to supervise the dissertation. The problem is since I don’t understand what is in his mind and his lecture material does not help either, I have no idea how to supervise the students properly. I did contact him in November at the start of this saga, but he didn’t answer my email.</p>
<p>But, I am very happy to be corrected if I am wrong on this.</p>
<p>When you have the time, please do look at it. I am happy to find a fair and amicable solution, but I am extremely surprised D’Maris is playing hardball with me on this and trying to scare me to back down. When it comes to fairness, I will not backdown, even if lose my job over this.</p>
<p>Please do feel like you have reply to this. But, please do look at the document when you have time.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Aniket</p>

<p>Aniket,</p>
<p>Many thanks for letting me know.</p>
<p>The issue that we have is that in an email to the student you commented on a number of things, each of which we could receive a complaint about – all of them together could have significant ramifications. I have received at least 6 emails from the students one at 6 oclock this morning distraught about what to do. So I am trying to understand her concerns, which I hope will result in an effective submission of her dissertation with Stani as supervisor.</p>
<p>I cannot second guess, but given your email to her the likelihood is that we will receive a formal complaint that will have to be escalated by Peter McLennan (faculty tutor) to the pro-vice Chancellor of teaching through a material irregularity. This will need to include your email to the student. <hi>As I can see from your email to the student, you have accepted responsibility for: inadequate teaching, unfair marking and second marking, inadequate supervision and you have also told the student that they are “not the best” and you are unwilling to supervise them on legal and moral ground. D’Maris wants to talk to you because she realises the significance of this on you, if this student makes a complaint.</hi></p>
<p>At this point, Stani is supervising the students and they are emailing me with issues and concerns.</p>

<p>Dear Grant,</p>
<p>You have no idea <hi>how horrified I was when Ruhana told me last week that I had accidentally copied in the student in replying to Natalya. I just hit the reply all button to include Ruhana, who was included in the original email.</hi></p>
<p><hi>My mistake entirely! It is a grave mistake on my part and I am going to take full responsibility for it and am willingly bear the consequences for that.</hi></p>
<p>This is not an excuse for my grave mistake, but <hi>my email makes more sense if you read Natalya (15th Nov) and John’s (21st Nov) email to the student. I brought in the moral, legal and ethical angle in response to the arguments John and Natalya were making to the student.</hi> Hence, the <hi>subtext of my email was - let’s not make those arguments because it is not right. I am not sure if you have read those emails and emails afterwards provide all important context.</hi></p>
<p>Last, but not least, my apologies for adding to your workload. <hi>I hate making mistakes but when I do, I am transparent about my shortcomings, which I will be in this case.</hi></p>

<p>Thank you. I know it was a mistake, we all make them.</p>
<p>At this point, we just have to be clear that we are all trying to rescue this situation ultimately for the good of the students - as you rightfully say we must give them all the support that they need.</p>
<p>I think it will all be fine, but D’Maris and Helen need to see that you understand the implications and severity of the situation.</p>

<p>Dear D’Maris,</p>
<p>Helen said that you wanted to meet me about the dissertation issue. <hi>I have been tried to raise this issue in a collegiate way with a number of people in the last few weeks, but unfortunately, no one wants to take the time to listen to my concerns. As I told Helen, Grant, Aeli and Ruhana in meetings in the last week, I am taking a stand on this because is an ethical issue of fairness.</hi></p>
<p>I thought a timeline would help and may reduce the time you would need to take to get to the bottom of this. My apologies because it is long and requires me to explain the background of the current issue.</p>
<p><code>---</code> Timeline <code>---</code></p>
<p>Summer 2018: I was the first marker for Chen, Li and Xu, Tiantian. John was the second marker.</p>
<ul>
<li>As as first marker, I wanted to mark them in their 50s. John felt very strongly that they should fail. Given his experience and overview of the course, I was happy to embrace my ignorance and very respectfully agreed to follow his lead.  </li>
</ul>
<p>My sense was that the disagreement was over the use of a specific research methodology. I thought given the research methodology they had been taught, they has written something adequate. John felt that they had not. John also told me that I don’t understand the specific Finance methodology and I was happy to follow his lead given his expertise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When it came time for Chen, Li and Xu, Tiantian to resubmit, I emailed John on 20th November suggesting that <hi>it would be in the students best interest</hi> if someone who understood the specific methodology would supervise the student. With my supervision, I was afraid that they would both fail. John never responded.</p></li>
<li><p>In stead, I started getting emails from Natalya ordering me to supervise the student. I thought Natalaya or John would respond to my concerns, especially about the legal complication that would arise if the students failed again. It would be easy for students to argue that they did not receive proper supervision, given the mismatch between my expertise and what they are being examined on. Unfortunately, no one was ready to take my concerns seriously. I thought that there would be collegiate way out but all I got was orders.</p></li>
<li><p><hi>Frustrated, and at my wits end because time was slipping away fast, I raised my concerns with Helen last week, who in turn asked me to raise it with Grant. I raised the issue with Grant.</hi></p></li>
<li><p>I am glad that the issue has inevitably landed up with you, but I think it could have been easily resolved with a reasonable conversation. I would have taken some extra dissertation students in an area I can supervise and someone else with expertise would have taken on Chen, Li and Xu, Tiantian.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code>---</code> End of Timeline <code>---</code></p>
<p>As you may know that <hi>I doing 7 hours of teaching each week currently on three different courses, one of which I am creating from scratch. I have tried my best to create a cutting edge course that is a step beyond the core-econ. I am confident that I have created course that would create a new cohort of extremely engaged CPM students.</hi></p>
<p>Conversely, <hi>every week I have to read 400 pages for the other courses I am a tutor on, which are simple below below par. There are huge problems with the courses and I have tried my best to raise issues in a collegiate way and help in any way that I can - something hopefully Grant would attest to.</hi></p>
<p>The problem seems to be that the <hi>lecturers feel extremely challenged when I make suggestions. Given my 20 years of teaching experience, it is baffling to me that someone would forgo the opportunity to discuss the material with me. Result is we are delivering blatantly wrong material in lectures. Examples of the lecture material being blatantly wrong are:</hi></p>
<ul>
<li>A <hi>lecture on moral hazard that describes a problem that has no moral hazard in it. The lecture was presenting a complete first-best contract where there is no moral hazard as a moral hazard problem.</hi></li>
<li>Or <hi>lecture on game theory where actually the lecturer has mistaken decision theory for game theory.</hi></li>
<li>Or a <hi>lecture where formulas on net present value calculation are wrong.</hi></li>
</ul>
<p><hi>If second year undergraduate in Economics would be failed if they made such mistakes in their examination.</hi></p>
<p>Given the <hi>gravity of the situation, when a student is failed, then there needs to be clear justification. We at CPM need to be clear that it is not a problem with the course material.<hi></p>
<p>I have <hi>done my best to raise concerns in a collegiate way for the last few weeks but John and Natalaya were not ready to listen. Hence, my stand on the dissertation issue is simply because I think I am being asked to something that challenges my ethics.<hi></p>
<p>Having said that, I would <hi>happily take on constructive criticism</hi> if you feel that I should have done things differently.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Aniket</p>

<p>I am really sorry, I just didn’t realise there was a meeting today. On Friday, you said that you would get back to me about Tuesday and I was waiting for you to get back. But, turns out it is in my dairy. I am really not sure how I missed your invite or accepted it.</p>
<p>John has put up 464 pages of reading for this afternoon’s tutorial, it is a bit of hectic blur preparing for it but I am really really sorry. I would never intentionally miss a meeting.  </p>
<p>Re: reconciling the marks, there are emails setting out my marks and then we have a two hour long meeting. I will send you the details in an email.</p>

<p>Hi Aniket</p>
<p>I am sorry but I was in another meeting when your phone call came in.</p>
<p>Regarding your argument that you are not qualified to supervise these dissertations because they are on a finance topic, Stani tells me you are co-supervising Lois’ Phd which is on real estate finance. I’m not sure I understand why you agreed to do this if you feel you’re not able to supervise in this area.</p>

<p>Dear D’Maris,</p>
<p>I am going to try my best to be short. It is explanation for why I did what I did. Something, I did not want to put in an email that others were cced into.</p>
<p>The way things transpired in October over Li, Chen and Xu, Tiantian’s marking <hi>left me with a distinct feeling that John had gone out of his way to fail both the student simply because I was supervising them. To exert his authority over me. I could be wrong, but the way he wrote the extremely long comments and the way he was insistent did not sound like objective marking. You may have seen in the emails that even Peter, the second marker for Li, Chen’s dissertation thought she should pass.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I care deeply about my students and was racked with guilt at the possibility that Li, Chen and Xu, Tiantian were failed because of me. </hi> I thought the easiest thing would be to either get John or someone else to supervise so that my students pass. <hi> All I wanted was that my students get a fair deal and pass, which would never happen if I remained the supervisor. After all, we are talking of people’s lives and their future. </hi></p>
<p>The <hi>language that Natalaya and John have used in their emails to Li, Chen shows a degree of apathy towards students that makes me cringe.</hi> I am sure they have not shown you those emails. They are worth reading.</p>
<p>My <hi>friends in Teaching and Learning group tell me that a group of people (not just Natalya) seized this issue as one they could weaponise against me.</hi> This is because I have been talking about changing this and improving the way we teach, which they find threatening. So, <hi> in stead of dealing with what was an urgent issue, Victoria spent ten days searching for regulation that would force me to supervise the students.</hi></p>
<p>As to why I took on Lois: Lois had trouble with Stani and so Michelle asked me to take her on as a favour. I would never say no to Michelle. Otherwise, I have no interest in taking on a Phd student, finance or otherwise.</p>
<p><hi>I have lost count of the petty humiliations that I have been subject to since I joined CPM. You have always fair and gracious to me. But, others have not been. But, I never thought I would be accused to trying to shirk responsibility. I have had fever for two days but that has not stopped me from delivering my 5 hours of teaching in two in days. So, the accusation that I am shirking responsibility is an amusing accusation.</hi></p>
<p>Best wishes,
Aniket</p>

<p>Hi Aniket</p>
<p>I have asked Helen to try to find a time today for you to come to see us. This has got entirely out of hand. You have to remember that CPM is actually larger than Newnham in terms of total students and teaching provision and far larger in terms of student income. <hi>I’m not ignoring you but I am irritated this drama has landed on my desk. Grant is the equivalent of Senior Tutor both in terms of role and seniority and ordinarily would have been able to resolve it absent the escalating accusations you are making about colleagues.</hi></p>
<p>We don’t have the catering and hotel business, but we are a very large operation. You are making allegations about colleagues which we need to discuss, <hi>but it’s frustrating to me to know that you wanted someone else to supervise these students not because, as you originally told Natalya and John, you don’t feel qualified but because you felt John would not second mark fairly. You should have taken this to Grant or the chair of the postgrad exam board two months ago.</hi></p>
<p>I have TRC this morning but will create the time this afternoon as I go to China tomorrow.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Dear D’Maris,</p>
<p><hi>It was John who told me that I was not qualified to judge the dissertations and that is why he was over-ruling me. So, how can John think I am not qualified in October and but qualified in November. I told Natalya what John told me.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I tried to talk with John asking him to help out. He didn’t answer. I tried Natalya, she took ten days to get back to me.</hi></p>
<p><hi>I went to talk to Grant at length about this again and again. I spoke to Helen too. No one seems to want to react. This is incompetence on their part, not mine.</hi></p>
<p><hi>If you mischaracterise my serious concerns and term it accusations, then I think you are taking a hostile attitude towards me and unnecessarily escalating the situation. It is up to, whether you want to amicable resolution or to escalate the situation. I am ready for both.</hi></p>

<p>Dear Aniket</p>
<p>I’m sorry we weren’t able to find a time to discuss this as it’s clearly causing you a lot of distress and is very concerning and frustrating for me at all, especially as you’re communicating very strongly that you have felt unhappy and badly treated at CPM, which I admit isn’t what I would have expected to hear from you. The last time we spoke about this in any detail, you seemed happy that CPM had helped you sort out the immigration issue via Ferguson Snell and seemed excited about research that you were doing on your own now that Jim is in Australia for six months and doesn’t need research support. I recognise that the autumn is a heavy teaching term, but I had thought things were going well now that you’ve passed your probation. That you obviously feel that this isn’t the case is something we do urgently need to discuss. </p>
<p>As for the rest, I haven’t discussed this with John at all or with Natalya, beyond telling her that I secured agreement from another colleague (who is a finance academic) to supervise these two students for their re-submission. I’ve only discussed it with Grant insofar as he needs to contact the students themselves to provide them with pastoral care and reassurance that they will be given the assistance they need to resubmit. By reassigning the dissertations, I have sorted that out the operational issues. </p>
<p>I think the rest will have to wait until next week. <hi>But I am not intentionally escalating this situation. I am just picking up on what you said below that you had the ‘distinct feeling that John had gone out of his way to fail both the student(s) simply because I was supervising’. That contains within it an accusation, as does the suggestion that your Teaching and Learning Group thinks that members of my team are trying to ‘weaponise this’ against you. You also told me that if I read their emails (which I have not had occasion to do) that I would see that John and Natalya have a bad attitude towards students. These are indeed accusations, which may or may not have merit, and they deserve careful consideration, as does the suggestion below that Grant and Helen have handled this incompetently.</hi></p>
<p>I don’t understand how I am escalating things by acknowledging that you have levelled these concerns, as they are serious enough to merit my involvement whereas otherwise a simple request to reassign dissertation supervision is something that Grant is empowered to handle himself. I am definitely not hostile towards you (and have known you for a long time), but I am really struggling to understand how this has got to this point. All that I can really say for sure is that it seems clear to me that you don’t have a particularly high opinion of the PML teaching, but PML started six weeks after the adjudication of the dissertation marks, which occurred in October. So that does seem to be a separate issue. </p>
<p>Anyway, with the reassignment of these students to Stani, I think the urgency about meeting today has passed. I’ll look forward to seeing you on Tuesday when I return. <hi>But from my point of view, I am acknowledging that you’ve raised very serious concerns (if you prefer that term to ‘accusations’) and that we need to discuss these in person. You said yourself last week that you’re glad that I’m now involved. My aim is to de-escalate the situation, but I don’t see how I can do that without first acknowledging the seriousness of the issues you’ve raised.</hi></p>
<p>All best</p>

<p>Dear D’Maris and Helen,</p>
<p>Please find attached my 13 page note on how the Li, Chen and Xu, Tiantian’s dissertation was marked and reconciled. The note contains a timeline followed with emails and other relevant document.</p>
<p>In Li, Chen’s case I was the first-market and Peter Hansford was the second-marker. I hope it is clear evidence that both Peter Hansford and I wanted to pass Li, Chen but John overruled us.</p>
<p>In Xu, Tiantian case, I was the first marker and Jonh the second marker. There is clear evidence in the email that I wanted to pass the dissertation but John overruled me.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need anything further on this.</p>

<p>Dear D’Maris,</p>
<p>First of all, I am really really sorry that I missed the meeting this morning. I am really not sure how I missed the calendar invite. I absolutely feel awful.</p>
<p>The argument that I was making has got extremely convoluted because no one is talking to me and taking my emails out of context. The arguments for Li, Chen and Xi, Tiantian’s dissertation is distinct from the reasons for Lois. It would be easier to explain in person. Having said that, I did not volunteer to take on Lois. I was asked to take it on and I was not sure if it was optional. If it was optional, I would not take her on. But, I am never sure what I am required to do and what I can say no to. Having said that, this does require a more detailed explanation.</p>
<p>There is also an issue of the teaching workload. There are a lot of problems in teaching and I seem to be compensating for other’s people problem. Again, it is an argument I can make more clearly in person when I see you next week.</p>
<p>Again, I am truly sorry for missing the meeting this morning.</p>
<p>Best wishes,
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Prof. Penn,</p>
<p>My sincere apologies for not following on our conversation at the book launch with an email. Part of the reason is that I have been dumped with a lot of teaching and wanted to write something up before I wrote to you, but as I was struggling with the teaching load, and it ended up becoming a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>The other reason is that <hi>I have been having a very difficult time at CPM at a personal level. I have challenged some unethical behaviour at CPM and as a result has been targeted. My situation at CPM is increasingly become untenable. The whole situation has been extremely stressful and I climbed into my shell as a defense mechanism.</hi></p>
<p>I also made some progress (but not enough) on three research ideas we talked about.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Doing something on the spatial economy of UK. I have an idea of how to bridge the gap between urban and regional economics literature.</p></li>
<li><p>Productivity: I have some preliminary results for a paper on the productivity puzzle. Turns out, aggregate level data is very misleading because it does not account for labour hoarding and firm exit and entry. Firm level data paint a different picture from the aggregate data. I have done some preliminary work on firm level data on construction sector and the results are promising.</p></li>
<li><p>Poverty in India: I have looked at the urban and rural poverty data in India. There are some really interesting puzzles (I will let the attached pictures speak for themselves) in the data and I have some preliminary ideas about how to study it. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>I am currently teaching Monday 11-1PM, Tuesday 2-5PM and Wednesday 3-5PM and am absolutely flexible otherwise. <hi>I apologise for taking up your time on this but I would be very very grateful for your advice if you have the time. All I want to do is focus on bringing my research ideas to fruition and find a way out of the petty politics and unproductive distractions at CPM.</hi></p>
<p>With kind regards,<br>
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Prof. Penn,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for seeing me last week. I have just been informed that when I met you last week, there was a ongoing GDPR issue that had been raised, which I was not aware of at the time.</p>
<p>The GDPR issue was grave oversight/mistake on my part and I willingly accept whatever consequences there for me. I also feel very guilty for causing such a big problem for Bartlett. I should have known better.</p>
<p>I am just writing to say that <hi>if I had known that there was a pending GDPR issue, given that you are the Dean, I would have waited for it to be resolved before I came to see you. My intention of coming to see you was solely to follow up on our conversation and seek some guidance about my research.</hi> And I was eager to do so before the end of term.</p>
<p><hi>My apologies for bothering you with this, but since this is weighing heavily on mind, I chose to write and explain myself. Hope that was not an inappropriate thing to do.</hi></p>
<p>Wishing you a very merry Christmas.</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br>
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Grant,</p>
<p>D’Maris just showed me the email where I had said “This is incompetence on their part, not mine.” Looking back, I have no idea why I put it that way. I had no intention of calling you incompetent. I was very very frustrated with the complication with the dissertation other teaching issues. You were extremely supportive. You took the time to listen to me and gave me excellent advice.</p>
<p>Since I have joined CPM, you have been extremely supportive. I would not dream of calling you incompetent. That was a hastily written email with very clumsy wording, which deviates million miles from either what I intended to say or what I actually think of you.</p>
<p>My fulsome unqualified apologies. These are not just words. I hope that from all my interaction with you, it is clear that I hold you in very high regard. I do hope you accept my unqualified apologies.</p>

<p>Dear Helen,</p>
<p>Please accept my sincere apologies for my intemperate and ill-advised words. Words escape very fast from fingers on the keyboard, yet emotions on the face don’t lie. I do hope you have seen the respect with which I speak to every time I come to see in your office. I have always admired your calmness and objectivity, something that I can only aspire to. So, I do hope you will accept my unqualified apologies for my words in the email.</p>
<p>I was very grateful that you pointed out I sounded resentful. As a reflective process, I have started making a list of things that have made me feel resentful at CPM. The list is turning out to be very very long and complicated and more institutional in nature than anything else. I also know that not everything on that list may be justified.  </p>
<p><hi>I feel very misunderstood and almost like a pressure cooker right now. The pressure at work is so incredible. What I have been asked to deliver at work, I find impossible to do. I have not been able to sleep more than 4 hours for the last 5 weeks. That’s how bad things are for me. That’s why I have been constantly talking about my workload issue recently, but found very little traction.</hi></p>
<p>I also knew that given the nature of academia, it would be very difficult to raise the issue without stepping on someone’s toes. I am very grateful that you identified it this morning, because it will hopefully start the process of coming to grips with it. I also really welcome the opportunity to get a fresh start with a new line manager, who can assess my workload.</p>
<p>I will reflect on it calmly over the break and at some opportune time next year, I would like to discuss some of the non-academic issues that complicated my life at CPM and would be very happy to take constructive criticism and feedback.</p>
<p>I do hope that you accept my sincere unqualified apologies. And I am really sorry for adding to your workload.</p>
<p>Hope you have a very Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>Dear Aniket</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting me; having discussed this with D’Maris, I think that you are correct in taking the holiday period to reflect on this.</p>
<p>Your mentor, Stefano, would be the best starting point for discussion around the non-academic issues you have mentioned below. D’Maris is, of course, happy to meet with you in the new year to discuss academic issues, but isn’t best placed to discuss non-academic or personal issues.</p>
<p>I would also like to share the good news that Stani has agreed to serve as your line manager, and you are very welcome to raise any concerns regarding the Economics teaching with her. I would encourage you to make an initial appointment to meet with her in the new year.</p>
<p>We are currently writing up the formal report from yesterday’s meeting, and this will follow in due course.</p>
<p>I wish you a very happy and restful holiday break, and would like to reiterate both D’Maris and my commitment to staff wellbeing.</p>

<p>Dear Aniket</p>
<p>Thanks for doing this marking. My comments are as follows:-</p>
<p>106611317 – agree mark
106756670 – I agree with your criticisms and for that reason would propose a mark of 48 (14+18+10+6)
106816803 – agree mark
106819910 – agree mark
106856675 – agree total mark but would redistribute as 60 (18+24+12+6). You have been quite complimentary about the Statement of problem and then only given it 17.
106867005 – agree mark
106908667 – I agree with your criticisms and for that reason would propose a mark of 46 (14+18+8+6)
106913936 – agree mark
106918854 – agree mark
106919816 – agree mark
106921633 – agree mark
106924936 – agree mark
106976360 – I agree with your criticisms and for that reason would propose a mark of 48 (15+18+10+5)
107083187 – agree mark</p>
<p>I do have a concern about some of the wording of the feedback.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Please do not use the word ‘dissertation’ when referring to the term paper. It is confusing to the students who we are trying to teach to use the right descriptions of different assignments.</li>
<li><hi>You have several assignments on which you write “The dissertation fails to motivate the problem properly”. I have no idea what this means – it certainly isn’t English.</hi></li>
<li><hi>A number of the conclusions have the comment “The conclusions follow from the analysis and lack and insights”. Again I have no idea what this means – it certainly isn’t English.</hi></li>
<li>106913936 – Conclusions - “The conclusions are well presented” but you have only given a mark of 11/20.</li>

The next four you write “The Presentation is average” - marks given 7, 6, 6, 5. This is precisely the sort of inconsistency on which students jump when criticising us.</hi></li>

<p>Can you please indicate if you agree the mark adjustments and whether you want me to adjust the comments.</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>A number of deadlines got bunched up this week, so I had a bit of long night.</p>
<p>The examination is written in latex. I use latex because it has a number of key advantages over word and other WYSIWYG software. Latex efficiently picks up the questions and answers from my question database, formats it and simultaneously creates examination question and the marking key. Since Latex produces pdf directly, reformatting it will require making changes to the latex files.</p>
<p>The particular format I have used follows UCL examination guidelines fairly closely. If there is anything specific that needs reformatting, it would be easiest to let me know. Unless you would like to change the latex files yourself, in which case, I can see you the latex code and the question database.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
Aniket</p>

<p>Hi Aniket,</p>
<p>WOW! :) Ok!</p>
<p>Well I’ve only started on it a little, so I will just need to make it digital accessible/disability friendly.</p>
<p>I’ll let you know (probably more tomorrow, if that is ok!)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Actually, latex is a standard for most scientific academic writing, so I had no option but to learn it.</p>
<p>If you either send me the changes or just a sample of what a disability friendly text looks like, I can change it and send it back to you fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Hi Aniket,</p>
<p>So I wonder if there is a few more things you could adjust.</p>
<p>On the Title Page, could you put it in this order please?</p>
<p>BCPM0058 – Economics
Class Test 1 and 2
Question Paper</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hr 30 mins</p>
<p>Can you delete the candidate number as the students will have a separate answer sheet?</p>
<p>On the second sentence on the Title Page, could you put something like:</p>
<p>This exam contains two tests: Class Test 1 and Class Test 2. You are advised to spend 45 minutes on each test.</p>
<p>Sentence 5 – you have a split word – exam-ination – could you join it together please?</p>
<p>Within the question paper, could we have the following please?</p>
<ul>
<li>Full stop or punctuation at the end of all sentences.</li>
<li>If a question is a “finish the sentence” question, can you please put a colon</li>
<li>Question 3 – could you join the word community on one line please?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer sheet – Could you do a separate cover sheet for that page so I can print it separately please?</p>
<p>BCPM0058 – Economics<br />
Class Test 1 and 2<br />
Answer Sheet</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hr 30 mins</p>
<p>And some steps of how to completed.</p>
<p>On the answer sheet, could you put the marks out of 20 after each section please?</p>
<p>In the top right of both cover sheets, could you add the UCL logo please?</p>
<p>We can chat tomorrow, if you are around.</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>I am not sure I understand why you want these changes, i.e., are these UCL regulations or a change in the Teaching &amp; Learning team’s best practice list? As you would appreciate, I spent a fair amount of time last year consulting with the T&amp;L team, the second marker, Alex and Green Onions initiative before coming up with an exam format for the in-class test.</p>
<p>I have briefly listed why the changes you have suggested are at variance with the advice I got from others last year. Going forward, I am very happy to stick to any best-practice list that T&amp;L team collates after requisite consultation so that everyone is on the same page. What is important is that everyone involved is consulted and are on the same page. Otherwise, we keep going in circles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We can’t put the duration as 1:30 minutes because there are two separate tests of 45 minutes each. It is very important to stress that. As things stand, these are separate tests. Given that students have to pass both tests, we have to make sure they don’t think of the test as one combined test of 1:30 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Re: separate answer sheet</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Niamh Murtagh through the Green Onions initiative has laid great stress on reducing printing at CPM. This is why we put the answer sheet at the back of the paper last year. Niamh would argue that printing another cover sheet is unnecessary for an in-class test. Further, marking becomes more laborious both for me and the second marker if there is a cover sheet that we have to flip every time we mark an answer sheet. The second marker and I have spoken at length of about the format of the exam and answer sheet. We have agreed to a format that works best for both of us. It would be inconsiderate if I change the format without consulting her.  </p>
<p>My understanding is that in-class tests are relatively informal and most things are up to the discretion of the module leader and the second marker. It is my responsibility to ensure that I give clear instructions to the students and answer all the questions they have during the examination. My understanding is that this is different from the final examination where everything needs to be done extremely formally.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Can you delete the candidate number as the students will have a separate answer sheet?</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a longstanding policy at CPM that examination papers always have candidate numbers so that students don’t try to cheat by exchanging examination paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>Punctuation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The punctuation in a multiple-choice question is a complicated issue and varies across the disciplines. Economics tends to follow the parsimonious approach and my second marker is happy with it. The role of the second marker is to pick up these kinds of issues. So, I am not sure where these concerns are coming from. If Alex has concerns, then I am happy to have a chat with him and explain the second marker and my views on this.</p>
<p>If you want to change things, it would be easiest to draw up a list of best practice after consultations and circulate it. Otherwise, it is very difficult for me to reconcile what different parts of CPM want from me. As I am sure you would appreciate, this in-class test is a very small part of my complicated teaching week where I am teaching across 4 different courses and keeping up with my research. I don’t want to go back to re-editing the in-class test unless there is something critical or urgent that contravenes UCL regulation.</p>
<p>I will mark the exams on Friday afternoon and send you the marks on an excel sheet once I have agreed on the marks with the second marker. Could you please send me your preferred mock of the excel sheet so that we can get it done in one go.</p>
<p>Best wishes,
Aniket</p>

<p>Hi Aniket,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response and I am more than happy to sit down in person and discuss this.</p>
<p>I completely understand your workload and adapting layout, punctuation etc isn’t at top of the list, however, that why I ask for it a week in advance so I would do the changes and take that workload from yourself.  However as it is completed on a different programme, it difficult to adapt it myself.</p>
<p>With regards to punctuation, the whole idea is to ensure continuity between all papers and all questions so I was just highlighting areas of importance to ensure all questions end the same.  In Economics 2 paper (attached) - nothing ends in a full stop, for example.</p>
<p>With regards to the separate answer paper - wouldn’t it be easier to have that separate from the question paper to stop flicking between multiple pages for the student?  Attached is the example of what I have done and will only use one piece of paper.  </p>
<p>I spoke to Alex and Shen yesterday regarding the timings of your tests.  If you are doing them back-to-back, you want the students to stop and wait until the next ones start?  Because they are all attached, the students can view the questions at any time.  Alex and Shen suggested that they continue through both tests during the time, rather than stopping and waiting.</p>
<p>There isn’t currently a best practices document for examination papers, however as a result of this examination process, I will be creating one.  We also discussed the digital accessibility process.</p>
<p>The last thing we want is to overburden you anymore.  As I said, I am more than happy to talk to you and discuss this further. Are you available tomorrow sometime?</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance</p>
<p>Andy</p>
