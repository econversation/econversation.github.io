<p>Hi Stani,</p>
<p>Hope you are well!</p>
<p>Could we possibly schedule a line-manager meeting whenever it is convenient for you this term so that I can update you on what I have been doing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basically, I have marked 46 dissertation for BCPM0001, lectured and set the final exam for the last two weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>I am currently working towards a research proposal that is due on 3rd February. <a href="https://www.rebuildingmacroeconomics.ac.uk/social-cooperation-hub-first-call/" class="uri">https://www.rebuildingmacroeconomics.ac.uk/social-cooperation-hub-first-call/</a> It is something I have been working on for the last two months.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know what would be convenient for you. The only time of the week that is difficult for me is Monday 11AM-1PM, when I lecture the first-years. Other than that, I am absolutely flexible.</p>
<p>With best wishes,
Aniket</p>

<p>Hi Stani,</p>
<p>There is no rush from side at all. April or May would be great for me as well.</p>
<p>Helen in her email in December had asked me to set up an appointment with you in the new year. So, I was just following up on it. But, later in the year would be better for me as well.</p>

<p>Dear Helen,</p>
<p>Thank you for Workplace Health referral. Regarding my teaching allocations, the Workplace Health referral documentation says that “this has been reviewed and the teaching allocations are within the normal boundaries for the role.”</p>
<p>I was not aware that this review process has already taken place. Stani also has not mentioned that the review was already complete. I would be grateful if you could send me some details so that I can have a better understanding of the review process. It would really help to have my job descriptions, the teaching load that is considered normal or consistent with my job descriptions and my current teaching load for 2019-20 as recorded by the CPM currently.</p>
<p>As you may appreciate, this is likely to come up during my conversation with the Workplace Health advisor and since I don’t have this information at hand, it would be difficult to have a conversation without this information.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help!</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br />
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Aniket</p>
<p>Thank you for your email, Stani did email me last week regarding this, and I did respond to her, so apologies if this hasn’t been passed onto you.</p>
<p>I have notes from a meeting with you in December 2018 where we discussed your workload, and D’Maris explained that we usually expect our Research Fellows to undertake 4-6 hours teaching for us as part of their contracts (I double checked this with HR who have confirmed that an average of 6 hours over the year is a normal expectation in the Research Fellow contracts, and this can be bunched together to fulfil teaching needs – this equates to 270 hours per year in total). Because your workload is the same as last year, we haven’t a further review of this though.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t normally expect that workload is addressed via the appraisal system (which is designed to set targets for the year ahead and to help colleagues in their development, however, as you raised health issues with Stani at your appraisal, which we weren’t previously aware of, it is absolutely right that we seek to support you with these. The mechanism we have for these is via the workplace health team – they will want to know that the teaching workload is within the normal remit of the role – which it is as previously discussed – but they can of course make recommendations around this if they feel that is appropriate once they have discussed your health needs with you.</p>
<p>I hope that helps – can I suggest that we meet (perhaps with Stani and D’Maris too) once you have met with the Workplace Health team and we can review their recommendations?</p>
<p>Best wishes<br />
Helen</p>

<p>Hi Aniket</p>
<p>I hope this finds you well. Now that we have the occupational health report back today, I want to follow-up with you about the concerns that you raised in your annual review and that are voiced in the OH report.</p>
<p>We understand that you feel your teaching load is causing you considerable stress and is interfering with your research productivity. We have discussed this with our HR business partners who are very firm that your teaching load is about two-thirds of the maximum that we can expect from core-funded research fellows (i.e. well within your contract), that it builds on your existing strengths (you have been teaching micro and macro for decades and have a PhD in development economics), and is suited to your role. We have been reassured that our policies and procedures on RF workloads are line with UCL HR policy. You cite your teaching load as the reason why you have not been able to produce any published research outputs in the last three years, but UCL HR does not believe that to be a credible explanation in itself. The OH report therefore suggests that we establish weekly or fortnightly line management meetings with you to understand why your teaching workload, which should not objectively be causing problems, is causing you such stress. Moreover, we need fortnightly line management meetings to understand why you’ve been unable to produce any research outputs as the growth model paper was submitted to SCED back in 2018 in the first instance and was rejected after review. I would have expected that least to be out by now.</p>
<p>I understand you make comparisons between your workload and the other two core-funded research fellows, one of whom was on an internal sabbatical this past year given her long-standing significant enabling contributions, and the other of whom works closely with an established member of staff to continue a research centre established by a deceased one. You do not have sight of their overall workloads, but I can reassure you that your workload is among the lightest in CPM, precisely because we’ve been trying to support you in developing your research career.</p>
<p>Given the need for weekly or fortnightly line management meetings and to ensure that your research and teaching workloads are considered together, Helen and I have decided that Judy should replace Stani as your line manager as she is in the best position to address these issues. From what I gather from your meeting with Stani yesterday and my own conversations with her, she does not understand why research productivity has been such an issue for you. I am confident that you and Judy can get to the bottom of this in line with the recommendations of the occupational health report. If you have any questions or concerns, I am happy to meet with you, Helen and Judy.</p>
<p>All best wishes</p>
<p>D’Maris</p>

<p>Dear Judy, </p>
<p>I am absolutely delighted that you are my line-manager. Could not have asked a better person to be my line-manager. Happy to talk anytime you would like that is convenient for you. </p>
<p>I should also tell you that I had a breakdown a few weeks ago due to cumulative stress. That’s why I had asked for a small reduction in my workload, but it seems CPM has dug its heel in.</p>
<p>I am entirely flexible this week, other than Thursday (17th) 9:30-10:30AM  (Meeting with Study Skills team from Centre for Languages &amp; International Education). I am also moving house this weekend. So, I may not have internet for the first couple of days early next week. </p>
<p>Please do let me know whatever day and time would work best for you to talk.</p>
<p>Looking forward to talking.</p>

<p>Dear D’Maris, </p>
<p>Thank you for your email. I have very carefully followed the UCL Development Conversation framework. As per this framework, I had a series of conversation with Stani, my old-line manager, over the last 6 weeks. We discussed a range of issues in detail as part of the annual review process. </p>
<p>I would prefer to continue this conversation within the UCL Development Conversation framework with my new line-manager Judy. In those conversations, I am very happy to explore my strengths and weaknesses as they pertain to the job and welcome any suggestions from her about how I can be more effective in my current role.</p>

<p>Dear all</p>
<p>That’s great - Helen. I can see now that after the completion of the pilot the decision was taken to hold these Development Conversations apart from the annual review process which retains the old forms and procedures. I think that’s a good idea given that covid19 has precluded a complete overhaul of the annual review procedure.</p>
<p>Anyway Aniket, thanks for checking in. Let me know if you need anything further on my end.</p>
<p>All best wishes</p>
<p>D’Maris</p>

<p>Dear Claire, </p>
<p>Thank you very much for your email. The matter is relatively complex and spans the whole three year period I have been at CPM. Given the complexity of the matter, I would really like an opportunity to speak with Gemma before I submit the statement. </p>
<p>While my decision to initiate a complaint procedure is considered one, I am very conscious that certain words are weighed down with history and meaning. Hence, I would like an opportunity to speak to Gemma and ensure that I am being entirely fair to the people I am complaining about. I will have the statement and supporting documents ready by the start of next week and will submit them as soon as I have had an opportunity to speak to Gemma.</p>
<p>My apologies for taking up your and Gemma’s time in this difficult period. I do hope that once I have submitted the statement and evidence, a swift resolution can be found.</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br>
Kumar</p>

<p>Ms Helen Pascoe
School Manager
The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management</p>
<p>09 September 2020</p>
<p>Dear Ms Pascoe,</p>
<p>Re: Dr Kumar Aniket</p>
<p>Date of Birth: 27 March 1974</p>
<p>Thank you for referring Dr Kumar Aniket to UCL Workplace Health. I was able to conduct an initial telephone assessment with Dr Aniket on Wednesday 09 September 2020 to discuss the issues outlined in your referral letter. Dr Aniket has given verbal consent allowing me to generate this report.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>As you are aware, Dr Aniket is employed full time as a Research Fellow. I note the reason for this referral is due to some health and work concerns.
Dr Aniket reported some work related concerns that he states were highlighted eighteen months ago. I am also aware that there has been no sickness absence. He also reported an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>CURRENT POSITION &amp; MEDICAL ASPECTS</strong></p>
<p>Following my assessment, there are some perceived work related concerns pertaining to demands and his role within the workplace. As you might be aware, The Health and Safety Executive identifies six key factors of work design that if not managed effectively are known to trigger work related stress or exacerbate symptoms of a pre-existing condition. These factors are demands, control, support, relationships, role and how changes are implemented within an organisation.</p>
<p>My findings are that Dr Aniket’s underlying medical health condition coupled with his work concerns have a functional impact on him in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulties concentrating</li>
<li>Anxiety symptoms</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr Aniket is aware of the support that is available through his General Practitioner
(GP). In addition, I have also highlighted support through UCL resources.</p>
<p><strong>FITNESS TO WORK</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, Dr Aniket is fit for work with some adjustments in order to minimise the risk of any work-related issues exacerbating his current symptoms. I would advise that you consider adjustments to remove the disadvantage that his current symptoms might be causing. Adjustments you may wish to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stress risk assessment as there are some perceived work related concerns in the workplace. UCL has a duty of care towards its staff and a legal obligation to provide a safe working environment. In my opinion, this assessment gives both the manager and the employee an opportunity to explore any negative work related stressors and to explore possible ways of addressing and resolving them, if appropriate. Information about the risk assessment can be found by following the link below:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/managing-stress-work-appendix-2">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/managing-stress-work-appendix-2</a></p>
<p>Click on appendix 2 and the ‘check list’ for the template.</p>
<p>However, additional guidance can also be accessed from the Health and Safety Executive site:
<a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/stress/standards">http://www.hse.gov.uk/stress/standards</a> / or manager’s toolkit:
<a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/stress/assets/docs/stress-talking-toolkit.pdf">http://www.hse.gov.uk/stress/assets/docs/stress-talking-toolkit.pdf</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Management support in the form of regular one to one meetings with Dr Aniket every week or fortnightly in order for him to highlight any concerns and for you to monitor his progress effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>I have highlighted additional support through UCL’s Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), Care First which is available for staff 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year. T: 0800 197 4510 or log on to the OHW EAP page: <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hr/occ_health/eap.php">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hr/occ_health/eap.php</a> or <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hr/occ_health/vitality-leaflet/2015-Vitality-Leaflet-with-password-box.pdf">Care first leaflet</a></p></li>
<li><p>I have also highlighted the importance of maintaining his overall health and wellbeing. However, additional guidance can be accessed from Care First Zest by logging on as follows: URL:<a href="www.ucl-zest.co.uk">www.ucl-zest.co.uk</a> Organisation Code: UCL1</p></li>
<li><p>Dr Aniket could also benefit from some additional self-help resources from Wellbeing @UCL, Mind and SilverCloud (online cognitive behavioural therapy) in order to help improve his overall health and mental wellbeing in the workplace through the following hyperlinks:</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/health-wellbeing/wellbeing-ucl">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/health-wellbeing/wellbeing-ucl</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/media/1993364/how-to-manage-stress_2015.pdf">How to manage stress</a></p></li>
<li><p>Dr Aniket could also benefit from some support through the new NHS and Public Health initiative on their Every Mind Matters campaign through the following link: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/">https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/</a></p></li>
<li><p>A further COVID 19 risk assessment is also advised and maintaining a COVID Secure working environment whilst adhering to UCL’s and government guidance as stipulated in the following links:</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/covid-secure.htm">https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/covid-secure.htm</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="%20https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="%20https://www.ucl.ac.uk/coronavirus/keeping-safe-campus">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/coronavirus/keeping-safe-campus</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>As the manager of this employee you will need to consider if the adjustments are reasonable, feasible and appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>PROGNOSIS</strong></p>
<p>Dr Aniket’s symptoms are unlikely to improve completely whilst the issues in the workplace remain unchanged. However, with the appropriate management support and team support he should be able to manage reasonably well in the workplace. In addition, a suitable stress risk assessment and regular reviews would minimise the risk of any work related issues exacerbating his symptoms.</p>
<p>I have not arranged any further follow up appointments. However, if you have any further questions or require additional advice please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br><br></p>

<p>Dear Kumar</p>
<p>Thank you for meeting with me today. We discussed options for resolution of this issue and you indicated that you would like to pursue informal resolution in the first instance. If that doesn’t work then you can follow UCL’s formal grievance policy.</p>
<p>We agreed that I would approach Christoph and ask if he would consider meeting you, ideally with your mentor (Stefano Miraglia?) to discuss your experiences in confidence. We will come back to you about this within the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>You can come back to me to discuss this issue, or anything else that happens, at any time.</p>
<p>As a reminder, UCL’s Employee Assistance Programme (details here) can provide practical information and advice about stress as well as counselling and emotional support. They can be contacted on 0800 197 4510, available 24 hrs a day. Our stress management policy can be found here.</p>

<p>Dear Gemma,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for speaking to me. I can confirm that I would like to pursue the informal resolution in the first instance and would welcome an opportunity to speak to Prof Christoph Linder. I would like to have my mentor Stefano Miraglia present for the conversation if that is possible.</p>
<p>On reflection, I felt that I was quite descriptive in our conversation today. In my narration, I fear I may not have been vocalised my complaint against Prof D’Maris Coffman and Ms Helen Pascoe precisely. My complaint can be briefly summarised in the following words.</p>
<p>“My complaint is that Prof D’Maris Coffman and Ms Helen Pascoe have consistently exhibited signs of implicit bias towards me in their interaction with me through the last three years. Due to the implicit bias, they have been quick to jump to the conclusion that I am at fault even when evidence pointed in another direction. They have never given me the benefit of the doubt. Their actions have belittled and humiliated me on various occasions. I have consistently been treated worse than my peers. While each incident can be seen as an aberration, when examined collectively, there is a discernable pattern of systematic discrimination.”</p>
<p>Could I please enquire about a couple of things that I have not been able to ascertain on my own.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I was hoping that you could also guide me towards the UCL policy that prescribes the teaching that Research Fellows could be asked to do. You mentioned 6 hours, but it is not clear to me how that translates to an academic workload model, i.e, what is the conversion rate that applies for marking, preparation, dissertation supervision and other admin duties to the hours per week measure. I would be grateful if you could guide me to exact policy document or the legal opinion on which the 6 hour policy is based so that I could read through the details myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I have asked Ms Helen Pascoe for my job description on file but I am yet to receive an answer. According to my notes, I had applied for Job Ref 1645766. The job was advertised on 22 May 2017 and closed on 27 June 2017. Could I please confirm that my job description is in line with the job I had applied for, i.e., Job Ref 1645766.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you very much for your help and my apologies for bothering you with these queries. I hope the conversation with Prof Linder materialises and the situation can be quickly resolved.</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br>
Kumar</p>

<p>Dear Kumar</p>
<p>Thank you for your email and apologies for the delayed response. I have been on annual leave.</p>
<p>Christoph has agreed to meet with you and Stefano and his EA will contact you to arrange it.</p>
<p>UCLs policy on Workload planning can be found here: <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/workload-allocation-framework-academic-staff">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/workload-allocation-framework-academic-staff</a>.</p>
<p>There is no UCL written policy of a maximum of 6 hours Teaching for Research staff, but its history stems from UKRI guidance found here <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/workload-allocation-framework-academic-staff">https://www.ukri.org/files/funding/ukri-fec-grant-terms-and-conditions-guidance-pdf/</a> The relevant paragraph is RG08. Although not all research staff are covered by these terms (including yourself) for parity we recommend the same maximum. You will see that the 6 hours includes all relevant admin, preparation and marking etc…</p>

<p>Dear Aniket, </p>
<p>As HR /OH have told us to have a meeting every two weeks apparently I should also take notes.</p>
<p>Can you let me know whether you think these notes are accurate? Please change anything you think is not. It will not be recorded until you are ok with it. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You’ve moved house and the new place is great and free from pollution which was affecting you and your stress so this is great news. Congratulations it looks lovely!</li>
<li>You will update occupational health on the episode of mental health during the summer which wasn’t reflected in the original report. You’re going to register with a GP as well and keep occupational health abreast of any other issues that they or your GP feel need to be included.</li>
<li>You have booked an appointment to see Christoph next week because you have decided that you do have grounds for grievance that you want to explore and possibly take forward. You have not finally decided whether you will go forward on the grievance or not.</li>
<li>The grievance relates - very broadly - to two things. Firstly, you feel your job description changed since you joined CPM. Between what you felt was too much teaching for a research fellow and other issues you were effectively not able to develop the research work that you wanted to or could have. </li>
<li>Secondly, the other issues are that you believe that D’Maris, as head of department and Helen as school manager have been biased against you. You pointed out that the HR guidelines on six hours teaching for RF’s including prep and admin was not what they have said to you in the past. You have documented other issues and specific incidences which you have not discussed with me which demonstrate this bias against you.</li>
<li>You also feel there are diversity issues and prejudice and bias at CPM. I haven’t pressed you to tell me specific incidences of what you think they are.</li>
<li>You haven’t quite decided how you will progress the grievance procedure but you see the material that you have at the moment as a threat and you want to make it understood. </li>
<li>What you really want to do is good research and you feel that’s your job and you feel that you will be able to pursue this if you feel that the grievance is heard. You believe there may be opportunities to do the sort of research you would like to effect in other parts of the Bartlett.</li>
<li>You are happy to continue teaching now, as you are also fit to, but you asked me what would happen if you refused to teach the tutorials on 0002. I have said I will find out.</li>
<li>I have also said that I will continue to explore whether we could replace you on 0002 now this term as it’s obviously a very bad fit for you and causing some stress, and in response the the OH stress assessment this summer it would be  - if we can- beneficial to take you off this short term and find something better fit long term. I have heard very clearly that you don’t feel that teaching tutorials is a good use of your time. </li>
<li>You made it clear that you do not see the meeting with Christoph as business as usual and you are hoping for the result of that meeting to be some kind of change or decision about how you will pursue research.</li>
<li>You have developed a research plan - around brickmaking and social and environmental costs in Bangladesh which you plan to apply for funding for with external colleagues. </li>
<li>We agreed to meet in two weeks time and aside from the action summarised in this note no other actions can be taken until you’ve had the conversation with Christoph that you want.
Let me know if there is anything else you want to include, </li>
</ol>
<p>Best wishes, </p>

<p>Dear Judy, </p>
<p>My apologies for delay in replying to this. The notes are absolutely fine and reflect our conversation accurately. Could please suggest two changes. Please do let me know if you think these changes are fine. </p>
<ul>
<li>Point 7: I would ideally like to remove the phrase “but you see the material that you have at the moment as a threat and you want to make it understood.”. I am just exploring my options at this stage and I may have mispoken if I used the word “threat” in our conversation. What I meant was more like I would like to keep my cards close to my chest for now.</li>
<li>We had discussed the fact that I don’t understand how my workload has been calculated for the last three years. I was wondering if we could just a line about it with any wording that you think is appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please do let me know if you think these changes are fine.</p>
<p>With best wishes, 
Aniket</p>

<p>Hi Aniket, morning !! </p>
<p>Totally fine - I will amend point 7 to delete the last half as you request. 
If I add to point 9, saying “ You don’t understand how your workload has been calculated in the last 3 years” would that put it in context ? If this is okay with you then I will send you another email with the rewritten points as a record of the meeting. 
When are you seeing Christoph by the way?</p>

<p>Hi Judy, </p>
<p>That would be perfect! Thank you very much!</p>
<p>The meeting with Christoph is on Friday at 12PM. Fingers crossed!!!</p>
<p>I have just finished the Tutorial group today. It is actually a lot of fun. A very interesting and engaged group that was even more engaged than last year’s group. There is one thing that I said I will check with you and get back to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1 were very keen to know about the presentation topic next week. I am not I recall what you had said about how the presentation topic will be communicated to them. Is the question already on the Moodle. Just let me know what I should tell them.</li>

<p>Hi Aniket</p>
<p>I have clarified the situation on 0002.</p>
<p>I am still exploring trying to get you off 0002 this term in response to your recent stress as a short term thing. Not easy given conditions. So I have no short term solution. Since OH have not said you should not teach it it has to be done in an informal way and I literally have no one else at present.</p>
<p>I had to speak with Gemma in HR to find out process on this <hi>if you decide to refuse to teach it.
Since it is - according to Gemma, a reasonable task, if you refuse to do so it will trigger performance management / or a disciplinary procedure. </hi></p>
<p>Let me know if you want to talk. I know 0002 kicks off tomorrow.</p>
<p>Best J</p>

<p>Hi Judy,</p>
<p>Thanks for giving it a try and talking to Gemma. I am really sorry you have to spend time doing this when I am sure you have so much on your plate.</p>
<p><hi>I am basically waiting to see what Christoph says on Friday. I will think of what I will do once I have spoken to him. I doubt I will stop teaching. It is just something I would never be able to do. </hi> I might go to Union if nothing comes out of the meeting with Christoph.</p>
<p>I am really grateful for time you have spent on this. At the risk of sounding over-dramatic, can I just say that I have not experienced the kindness you shown me from anyone else at CPM since I have joined. I am overwhelmed that someone in CPM actually cares. So, a big thank you for that.</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br>

Subject: Serious issues (long email)
Date: 13 July 2021 at 17:18:48 BST
To: &quot;Stephenson, Judy&quot; &lt;j.stephenson@ucl.ac.uk&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Dear Judy,</p>
<p>My apologies for what is going to be a long email. <hi>The length of the email reflects both the difficult situation I find myself in and the list of issues that have taken a toll on my mental health.</hi></p>
<p>The straw that broke the camel’s metaphorical back is a set of puzzling directives I have received about the new procedure for resits and deferrals for 0058. As an educator devoted to the students, I am always eager to implement any suggestion that would help the students. In this case, unfortunately, I fear that these new directives misread the problem of the 0058 resit/deferral students at best and are misdirecting scarce resources away from the real problem at worst.</p>
<p>The reason why 0058 has been so popular with the cohorts in the past is because of my approach of diagnostic pedagogic. It is an approach that follows the Heckman-Cunha model of cognitive development as (laid out in their seminal paper Cunha Heckman (2007), reference below) and the work on diversity and cognition by Richard Nessbitt. The key to this approach is understanding the role dynamic complementarities play in the cognitive development process and then using it to diagnose and identify the individual specific stumbling block.</p>
<p>While the previous leaders of the undergraduate programme were keen to both allow and learn from the intellectual diversity within the undergraduate programme, it is unfortunate that the current leader Selcuk Cidik has chosen not to build on his predecessor’s successes. Instead, his approach has been to re-invent everything. While gradual consultative change has the potential to be useful, radical change has the potential of being extremely disruptive.</p>
<p>It has been a dystopian academic year where a bewildering range of “top-down” bureaucratic changes have left the module leaders confused. And when the module leaders are confused, they can’t do what they do best - teach. I have never seen such dissatisfaction in the undergraduate programme, both on part of the students and module leaders, as I have seen this year. I have also been particularly stuck by Selcuk’s tendency to take credit for everything positive and blame someone else (usually the module leader) for all the problems. It is difficult to overstate the corrosive effect the culture of blame has had on the undergraduate programme.</p>
<p>Specifically, in terms of 0058, Selcuk has taken an approach where he has tried to micro-manage every single tiny aspect of the 0058 course leaving no latitude for me as a module leader to take any decisions based on my assessment. (On one extreme instance, he attempted to interfere in the marking process and sent me an email contradicting my feedback on term papers and adding his comments.)</p>
<p>It has been a year of radically ill-advised experimentation through diktats and directives without any consultation. This is in stark contrast to the approach followed by his two predecessors, Alex Opuku and Aeli Roberts. Unfortunately, when Selcuk’s experiments went wrong, as they have in 0058, and students complained, Selcuk has failed to take responsibility. Instead, his approach has been to blame the module leader for everything.</p>
<p>For every tiny issue, I have had to fight tooth and nail to be allowed to do what I think is in the best interest of the students. On every tiny issue, my judgement has been questioned by Selcuk.</p>
<p>The time, energy and mental resources it takes to fight Selcuk’s diktats and directive is enormous and has taken a toll on my mental health. What has compounded the problem is that Andy has failed to provide adequate administration for the course. I have detailed the long list of Andy’s missteps in an email dated 22nd March 2021 to the Teaching and Learning manager.</p>
<p>I have always been grateful for your support in this matter. Out of consideration for your time, I have hesitated in the past to bring every single matter to your attention. Needless to say, the list of issues is long. 0058 was a beautifully run course before Selcuk came and decided to re-invent everything.</p>
<p>This brings me to the current set of directives. The students in 0058 have received extensive individualised feedback both on their formal and informal submissions. I have diagnosed and provided students with individualised verbal and written feedback and as a result, I can confidently say that I have actualised each student’s potential to the fullest extent possible. Even a cursory look at the Term Papers would reflect the cognitive development 0058 has been able to facilitate.</p>
<p>The case of Rhayna Rijanto illustrates the point. She was extremely vocal about the problems in the course because of Selcuk’s experimentation at the start of the year. It was hard work for me to gain the trust of the students including that of Rhayna after the initial problems. Rhayna scored 56 on the first term paper and was extremely disappointed with her mark. Rhayna spoke to me at length during term two about the course. I was able to diagnose the key problem she was facing. Rhayna scored 75 in her second term paper. She wrote a fascinating thought-provoking paper that is worth reading. This shows you what a course like 0058 can do for the students. There are numerous other examples like Rhayna of students who I have tried my level best to help in any way that I can.</p>
<p>Several students have been in touch with me to ask me for further reading material so that they can continue the intellectual journey they started in 0058. Unfortunately, the metric CPM/BSSC uses to evaluate courses does not take the cognitive development of the students into account. I remain mystified how the achievements of 0058 remain such a well-kept secret within the programme.</p>
<p>There is not a single student who is resitting due to a lack of individualised advice. The only students resitting are the ones that had followed poor academic practice. I was supposed to be initially involved in informing students of their poor academic practice and give them advice on how to improve. I am not sure what happened because I was not kept in the loop. So, I don’t know how things stand as far as the cases of poor academic case conduct in 0058 are concerned. As I understand from the limited information I have been given, these are the students who are resitting.</p>
<p>Each student usually has a different set of problems and I am convinced that the one “size fits all” “top-down” bureaucratic approach of issuing directives without consultation with module leaders is detrimental to the student’s interest. It leaves module leaders confused and dazed. This stands in stark contrast with the more genial collegiate approach in the undergraduate programme in previous years.</p>
<p>The second problem with Selcuk’s directive is its implication on my workload. Since 2018, when the method of assessing the workload at CPM/BSSC was changed from a quantitative one to a qualitative one, I have on numerous instances made the following two points to my previous line-managers.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>My workload does not reflect the actual time it takes to do the work allocated to me. There is a key distinction between ex-ante workload and ex-post workload. While the ex-ante workload may have been calculated based on some assumptions, the reality could always deviate from those initial assumptions. Best practice should ensure that both ex-ante workload and ex-post workload is calculated. As I had pointed out on numerous occasions to my previous line managers, there is a vast difference between my ex-ante workload and ex-post workload in my time at UCL.</li>
</ol>
<p>Selcuk, in pursuit of his various experiments, has issued several uncompromising diktats asking me to make significant changes to the 0058 course. These diktats have increased my workload by a significant amount. What concerns me is that he bypasses the line-management system and issues diktats directly to me. This naturally implies that the ex-post workload is far greater than the ex-ante workload calculation at the start of the academic year.</p>
<p>It needs to be appreciated that the new directives on resit/deferrals are extremely arduous when applied to 0058. I had made plans to work with my research collaborators in July and early August. I am sure you would appreciate how difficult it is to work in an unpredictable environment where all plans can be undone by diktats. This unpredictable environment of sudden “demand” and “control” are related to factors that trigger stress and was noted in my workplace health report dated 9 September 2021.</p>
<p>It has been a very difficult year, where I have continued to deal with the mental health issues arising from the culture at CPM/BSSC. I have given everything in order to ensure that 0058 and 0008 have been run as exemplary courses. Unfortunately, the bureaucracy associated with the course has proved to be extremely time-consuming, unpredictable, overwhelming and mentally exhausting. After I had done everything asked of me, I had hoped to get a clear stretch when I could focus on my research, which should be the primary focus of my job as a Research Fellow. Instead, I have been handed down another arduous task bypassing the line management system with no reassurance that an ex-post workload would ever be calculated for the academic year 2020-21.</p>
<p>What the students resitting 0058 need is advice about good academic practice. Since I have been kept out of the loop on what happened earlier in the year regarding cases of poor academic practice, it puts me in an awkward position of not knowing exactly how things are in my own course. On my part, I have already offered to provide individualised attention to students who are resitting. At least one student called Shuyu Liu has already got in touch.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>My second concern is about tasks that lead to promotion and tasks that do not lead to promotions. In my time at CPM/BSSC, my workload has been dominated by tasks that do not lead to promotion. This is in stark contrast to the opportunities that have been offered to my colleagues. The disproportionate amount of time I have spent doing PGTA work is difficult to reconcile with my teaching experience and leadership roles at some of the best institutions in the world. As you may be aware, the UCL Eugenics report has identified this particular pattern as evidence of systemic racism.</li>
</ol>
<p>While my previous line managers have robustly argued that I have not been given opportunities in terms of tasks that lead to promotion because of my “incompetence”, the Eugenics report has recommended (Recommendation 5) that this line of thinking may follow the established ‘normativity’ culture within UCL where a BME person is unfairly perceived as being incompetent. I am quoting recommendation 5 from the Eugenics report below (Inquiry into the History of Eugenics at UCL – Final Report, page 27).</p>
<p>“In order to disrupt the ‘normativity’ promoted by eugenics, UCL to establish and invest in a ‘Pipeline to Promotion’ scheme to improve BAME and disabled representation in senior levels of academic staff and professional services. This scheme should begin with an announcement by the Provost of a) an immediate review into BAME staff retention and b) a review to identify BAME or disabled staff members who have been at same level for more than 5 years.”</p>
<p>My lack of professional growth at UCL stands in stark contrast to my professional growth at Cambridge. As we begin to approach my 5-year mark at UCL, I have started engaging with different parts of UCL in trying to understand whether UCL’s normativity culture has impeded my professional growth at UCL.</p>
<p>While there may have been difficult issues with my previous line managers, I would like to add that you have been exceptional in supporting me since you became my line manager at the start of the academic year. You have taken the time to understand my perspective and I do greatly value your support and advice.</p>
<p>While I am always keen to hear and take on board constructive criticism, I have found the circumstances surrounding 0058 extremely difficult to deal with. A course that should not have taken a significant amount of time to teach has taken over my life and made my life extremely difficult in a year that I have struggled with my mental health. I am struggling to deal with the unpredictable bureaucracy which constantly impinges both my research time and mental health.</p>
<p>As ever, I feel guilty about taking up so much of your time with such a long email. Over the year, I have hesitated to raise every small issue with you. I had a dawning realisation this week that dealing with small issues over the course of the year has added up to a significant amount of time and overwhelmed me mentally. Hence, this long email and setting out the issues.</p>
<p>I do hope that it is a matter that can be amicably resolved with the School and I can go back to the window of research time I had been promised in July and August. If Selcuk or BSSC need to continue to experiment and reinvent 0058 and add bureaucratic hurdles, then they need to find the appropriate resources to do so. If I am to run 0058, then BSSC needs to trust me with the course and we need to return to the atmosphere of consultative collegiality of the previous years.</p>
<p>If this proves controversial and BSSC feels the need to escalate this issue to HR or the Dean, I am happy to do so since it captures exactly the point I have been trying to make for the last four years about the issues of workload and culture of normativity at CPM/BSSC.</p>
<p>I am happy to do anything reasonable that I am asked to till the time the line-management approach is adhered to, everything that I am asked to do is properly recorded and I am offered the same promotion opportunities that are offered to my colleagues as a matter of due course. I hope that is not too much to ask for.</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br />

Really sorry that all of this has become so difficult. Certainly that’s not the intention. We’re just trying to get kids supported. Shall you and I have a chat maybe later today?
If they’ve already had individualised feedback that should cover that. There is a simple issue of an online quick session.

<p>Dear Judy, </p>
<p>Thank you for the chat. </p>
<p>I just wanted to clarify the UCL HR policy around the workload issue. Enclosed below is the email below from Gemma Andrews to me dated 25 September 2020. The email was in response to my email dated 8 September 2020 where I had specifically enquired about the teaching workload associated with my job. Since Helen has not clarified the issue despite my repeated request to do so, I had emailed Gemma Andrews on 8th September. In the email, Gemma Andrew states and I quote verbatim from her email below: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no UCL written policy of a maximum of 6 hours Teaching for Research staff, but its history stems from UKRI guidance found here <a href="https://www.ukri.org/files/funding/ukri-fec-grant-terms-and-conditions-guidance-pdf/" class="uri">https://www.ukri.org/files/funding/ukri-fec-grant-terms-and-conditions-guidance-pdf/</a>  The relevant paragraph is RG08. Although not all research staff are covered by these terms (including yourself) for parity we recommend the same maximum. You will see that the 6 hours, includes all relevant admin, preparation and marking etc … </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am forwarding Gemma Andrew’s email dated 25 September 2020 along with my email that she was responding to. Her email makes it clear that 6 hours figure includes all relevant admin, preparation and marking time. While there has never been ambiguity regarding this from UCL HR side, the policy within CPM/BSSC has always remained ambiguous. The background to this email is that Stani and I had tried to obtain this information from Helen in August 2020 and failed to get it.</p>
<p>I don’t want to raise this issue at this stage and the email is only for information since we often return to this topic in our conversation and it takes up your valuable time. As far as I am concerned, there has never been any ambiguity around this issue. From my perspective, the ambiguity that has been created around the workload issue within CPM/BSSC is intentional and directly related to institutional racism, i.e., to the racial tropes used against people of colour of being lazy and incompetent, not doing their job properly and complaining.</p>
<p>The email from Gemma Andrews is only for your eyes and I would be grateful if you don’t share it with anyone at this stage because it is likely to be part of my grievance case. Happy to do my best to clarify anything regarding the emails enclosed below.</p>
<p>With best wishes,<br />
Aniket</p>

<p>Dear Aniket,</p>
<p>It was great to catch up today. Thanks for taking the time and it’s good to see that you are returning to good health. As agreed I’m copying Helen because there’s some procedural stuff in this email. </p>
<p>We discussed your occupational health report.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything in it is accurate apart from the fact that you have told me you do not have workplace stress but that you are suffering from systematic racism at work  and that is what you have told occupational health a number of times and they have recorded it as stress. I have sent you the stress risk assessment form but due to the fact that it is racism that is the problem we felt it not appropriate to complete it this afternoon.</li>
</ul>
<p>We talked about the fact that since you do not have any teaching between now and the end of September this gives you time to work on the three papers you want to submit/resubmit to journals by this time. </p>
<p>I will consult with Helen on what we do about the stress risk assessment as HR wanted me to have it filled out. And we can formalise goals and things after we know what the situation is with that. </p>
<p>You have told me that there are no other issues of going forward. You are aware of that workload for next year will be confirmed early next term.</p>
<p>As we only had an hour if there are any other questions or issues that you want to clarify please contact me immediately otherwise I look forward to returning to you about the workplace stress/racism issue. </p>
<p>Best wishes, </p>
<p>Judy </p>

<p>Dear Judy,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for taking the time to chat yesterday. It is always a pleasure to catch up with you. I can confirm your account of the meeting is accurate.</p>
<p>If I could just add the following. I want to confirm that on the three occasions I have spoken to the Workplace health advisors (9 September 2020, 17 December 2021, 28 January 2022) I have been clear in articulating my problem at CPM/BSSC emanating from systemic racism. There is no ambiguity from my side. I am also at a loss to understand how these issues have been conflated.</p>
<p>In fact, mis-classifying conflating racism and stress from other sources is itself a instance of systemic racism. Thank you very much Judy for recording the discrepancy.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
Aniket</p>

<p>Thank you for this clarity. It’s critical, and I agree that it is itself a problem in this regard. Will be back you asap.</p>
