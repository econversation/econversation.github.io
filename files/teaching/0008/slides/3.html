# Kerala Fish Market

# Coastal Fish Market in Kerala

Fish is the staple diet in Kerala, India

Kerala has a long coastline with fish markets dotted along the coast

Fisherman have a choice of which markets they want to land their fish in

.pull-left[
Fisherman face an information problem after they catch their fish

They do not know the **price of fish** in each market on a particular day.

# Kerala Fish Market

Jenson 2007&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; studied of 15 fish markets along the 225 km Northern coast of Kerala to understand whether the market for fish was working

- Fisherman had to **choose** the port/market where they would get the best price for their catch

- Fish merchants bought the fish from the fisherman and sold it to the consumers

- If fish merchants already had enough fish on the port they landed, the fisherman would just **jettison** their catch

&amp;nbsp;

Fish *prices were high* and fisherman’s *profits low* due to **wastage** and **bargaining power** of fish merchants who bought from the fisherman and sold to the consumers

.emn[**Notes**


Markets stop working if there is either excess supply or excess demand. 

- If there is **excess supply**, the prices drops to zero. 

- If there is **excess demand**, the price rises initially but the price of last few transactions don't signify anything once there is no fish left for customers to buy, at any price. 

- The **market clears** if the demand and supply are equalised.  The price in these markets are above zero and below the price in the markets with excess demand.

# Sequential roll out of mobile phone coverage


&lt;img src="images/lec3/f1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

.emn[**Notes**

We can see in the previous figure that the mobile phones were rolled out sequentially in the three areas (Region I, II and III) the paper studies. What is striking is the *drop in volatility of daily prices* as the mobile phones are rolled. 

The drop in volatility of price leads to both fisherman (people who supply the fish) and consumers (people who demand the fish) being better off. Consumer price drops and the fisherman's profits increase. 

This is because the **transaction cost**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the market has decreased. In the fish market, the cost of acquiring information was a large part of the the transaction cost. The transaction cost dropped because of the introduction of a **public good**, i.e., the mobile phone network. 

It is public good that would have been too expensive for the fisherman to provide for themselves because of the increasing returns to scale.]

.footnote[
[1] &amp;nbsp; **Transaction cost** is simply the cost in making a economic trade.

# Introduction of mobile phones

&lt;img src="images/lec3/f2.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.pull-left[Sharp decrease in .embb[price] volatility. Reduced .embb[waste] &amp; elimination.]

.pull-right[Fisherman's .embb[profits] went up by 8%. Consumer .embb[prices] decreased by 4%]

.emn[
**Notes**

Mobile phone network is public good that has a very *high increasing returns to scale*. The **scale** here is the **number** of people who have access to mobile phones. If the number is small, the benefits are more limited. As the numbers increase, the benefits increase too. If we start from a very small scale, say one-tenth of the population being covered by mobile phones and double the network, so that one-fifth of the population is covered, it is intuitive that the pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits accrued will be more than doubled. This will keep happening till the full population is covered. 

Mobile phones have two components in its provisions. The first one is establishing the network. This entails creating a regulatory framework within which mobile operators operate. Only once this regulatory framework is established and mobile phone operators obtain their licence to operate that they start making their private investments in building mobile phone base stations that facilitate mobile phone communication. 

The *private investment* (private capital formation) only happens once the *public good* (public capital formation) is in place.

# Market Efficiency

Introduction of mobile phones made the fish market more efficient

.center[i.e., .embb[a Pareto Improvement]]

&amp;nbsp;

-  Reduced waste &amp; elimination

-  Sharp decrease in price volatility 

-  Fisherman’s profits went up by 8%  

-  Consumer prices decreased by 4%

# Adam Smith's insight


.mybox[
.center[Well-functioning **markets** are Pareto **efficient**. ]
]

That is *all mutually beneficial trades are undertaken* and no trades than can make someone better off without making anyone worse off are left unexploited.

&amp;nbsp;

**Well-functioning markets: **

- No one has market power 

- No information problem between the buyer and the seller

- No externalities

There is a .embb[feedback loop] between economic growth and public capital.
