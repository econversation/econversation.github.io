**Transaction cost economics**: 

- What is a transaction cost? 

- Does Transactions take the firms as a given and maps the transactions of the firm within the market. 

Definition transaction: the act exchange between a buyer and seller. 

### 1.0.1. wikipedia

From this [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost). 

Oliver E. **Williamson** defines *transaction costs* as the costs of running an economic system of companies, and unlike production costs, decision-makers determine strategies of companies by measuring transaction costs and production costs. Transaction costs are the total costs of making a transaction, including the cost of planning, deciding, changing plans, resolving disputes, and after-sales. Therefore, the transaction cost is one of the most significant factors in business operation and management. Oliver E. Williamson's Transaction Cost Economics popularised the concept of transaction costs. 

Douglass C. **North** argues that institutions, understood as the set of rules in a society, are key in the determination of transaction costs. In this sense, institutions that facilitate low transaction costs, boost economic growth.

Douglass North states that there are four factors that comprise transaction costs â€“ "*measurement*", "*enforcement*", "*ideological attitudes and perceptions*", and "*the size of the market*".

- *measurement*:  refers to the calculation of the value of all aspects of the good or service involved in the transaction.
- *enforcement*: can be defined as the need for an unbiased third party to ensure that neither party involved in the transaction reneges on their part of the deal.
- *ideological attitudes and perceptions*: ideological attitudes and perceptions encapsulate each individual's set of values, which influences their interpretation of the world.
- *the size of the market*: it affects the partiality or impartiality of transactions.


*Transaction costs* can be divided into three broad **categories**:

- *Search and information costs* are costs such as in determining that the required good is available on the market, which has the lowest price, etc.
- *Bargaining and decision costs* are the costs required to come to an acceptable agreement with the other party to the transaction, drawing up an appropriate contract and so on.^[In game theory this is analyzed for instance in the game of chicken. On asset markets and in organizational economics, the transaction cost is some function of the distance between the supply and demand.]
- *Policing and enforcement costs* are the costs of making sure the other party sticks to the terms of the contract, and taking appropriate action (often through the legal system) if this turns out not to be the case.

For example, the buyer of a used car faces a variety of different transaction costs. The *search costs* are the costs of finding a car and determining the car's condition. The *bargaining costs* are the costs of negotiating a price with the seller. The *policing* and *enforcement costs* are the costs of ensuring that the seller delivers the car in the promised condition.

What areas of economics are relevant for project management? 

- Transaction cost economics
- Institutional economics
- Game Theory
- Environmental Economics

What are markets? Decentralised transactions between the producers and consumers.

the underlying them units all field are that markets don't work and society has mechanism for resurrecting markets,

Units of analysis: 

- Markets (nature of competition)
